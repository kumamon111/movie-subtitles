Hi. Uh, I have an appointment
with Emily Charlton?</p>

<p>14
00:03:34,640 &ndash;&gt; 00:03:38,000
- Andrea Sachs?
- Yes.</p>

<p>15
00:03:38,080 &ndash;&gt; 00:03:41,440
Great. Human Resources certainly
has an odd sense of humor.</p>

<p>16
00:03:41,560 &ndash;&gt; 00:03:43,440
Follow me.</p>

<p>17
00:03:45,160 &ndash;&gt; 00:03:47,520
Okay, so I was Miranda&rsquo;s
second assistant&hellip;</p>

<p>18
00:03:47,600 &ndash;&gt; 00:03:50,600
but her first assistant recently got promoted,
and so now I&rsquo;m the first.</p>

<p>19
00:03:50,720 &ndash;&gt; 00:03:52,920
- Oh, and you&rsquo;re replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.</p>

<p>20
00:03:53,000 &ndash;&gt; 00:03:55,320
Miranda sacked the last two girls
after only a few weeks.</p>

<p>21
00:03:55,400 &ndash;&gt; 00:03:57,720
We need to find someone who can survive here.
Do you understand?</p>

<p>22
00:03:57,800 &ndash;&gt; 00:03:59,680
Yeah. Of course. Who&rsquo;s Miranda?</p>

<p>23
00:03:59,760 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:02,920
Oh, my God. I will pretend
you did not just ask me that.</p>

<p>24
00:04:03,040 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:05,760
<i>She&rsquo;s the editor in chief of Runway,
not to mention a legend.</i></p>

<p>25
00:04:05,840 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:09,680
You work a year for her, and you can
get a job at any magazine you want.</p>

<p>26
00:04:09,760 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:12,000
A million girls would kill for this job.</p>

<p>27
00:04:12,120 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:14,800
It sounds like a great opportunity.
I&rsquo;d love to be considered.</p>

<i>Andrea,
Runway is a fashion magazine&hellip;</i></p>

<p>30
00:04:20,640 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:23,480
so an interest in fashion is crucial.</p>

<p>31
00:04:23,560 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:25,840
What makes you think
I&rsquo;m not interested in fashion?</p>

No! No! No!</p>

<p>34
00:04:31,680 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:33,760
What&rsquo;s wrong?</p>

<p>35
00:04:38,880 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:41,440
She&rsquo;s on her way. Tell everyone!</p>

<p>36
00:04:41,560 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:43,920
She&rsquo;s not supposed to be here
until 9:00.</p>

<p>37
00:04:44,000 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:46,880
Her driver just text messaged,
and her facialist ruptured a disk.</p>

<p>38
00:04:46,960 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:50,040
- God, these people!
- [Whistles, Whispers] Who&rsquo;s that?</p>

<p>39
00:04:50,120 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:53,200
That I can&rsquo;t even talk about.</p>

<p>40
00:04:53,280 &ndash;&gt; 00:04:55,680
All right, everyone! Gird your loins!</p>

She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.</p>

I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30

- [Whispers] 9:45 sharp.
- Call Natalie at Glorious Foods,

No, I don&rsquo;t want dacquoise. I want tortes

for that feature on the female paratroopers&hellip;</p>

<p>59
00:06:54,600 &ndash;&gt; 00:06:56,320
and they&rsquo;re all so deeply unattractive.</p>

<p>60
00:06:56,440 &ndash;&gt; 00:06:59,480
Is it impossible to find a lovely,
slender female paratrooper?</p>

<p>61
00:06:59,600 &ndash;&gt; 00:07:03,160
- No.
- Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.</p>

<p>82
00:08:13,520 &ndash;&gt; 00:08:15,680

- Oh, yes. Our best September ever.</p>

<p>309
00:20:23,960 &ndash;&gt; 00:20:28,320
Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets
and pulled up the Sedona shoot.</p>

<p>310
00:20:29,320 &ndash;&gt; 00:20:31,200
What&rsquo;s that costing me?</p>

<p>311
00:20:31,280 &ndash;&gt; 00:20:33,360
About 300,000.</p>

<p>312
00:20:33,440 &ndash;&gt; 00:20:36,480
Must have been some lousy jackets.</p>

No. No, I just-
It&rsquo;s just baffling to me.</p>

<p>325
00:21:14,880 &ndash;&gt; 00:21:18,200
Why is it so impossible

<i>You people have had hours and hours

<p>328
00:21:25,120 &ndash;&gt; 00:21:28,120
- We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
- We need more, don&rsquo;t we?</p>

<p>329
00:21:28,240 &ndash;&gt; 00:21:32,000

<i>Well, you know me.</i></p>

<p>331
00:21:33,680 &ndash;&gt; 00:21:36,440
Give me a full ballerina skirt

<p>332
00:21:36,520 &ndash;&gt; 00:21:39,840
<i>- But do you think it&rsquo;s too much like-
- Like the Lacroix from July?</i></p>

<p>333
00:21:39,920 &ndash;&gt; 00:21:42,720
I thought that, but no, not with
the right accessories. It should work.</p>

<p>334

Where are the belts for this dre-
Why is no one ready?</p>

<p>349

But what you don&rsquo;t know
is that that sweater is not just blue.</p>

<p>350
00:22:38,280 &ndash;&gt; 00:22:40,720
It&rsquo;s not turquoise. It&rsquo;s not lapis.</p>

<p>351

It&rsquo;s actually cerulean.</p>

<p>352
00:22:43,000 &ndash;&gt; 00:22:44,960

of the fact&hellip;</p>

<p>353
00:22:45,080 &ndash;&gt; 00:22:49,200
<i>that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta

Yves Saint Laurent- wasn&rsquo;t it-</i></p>

<p>355
00:22:51,840 &ndash;&gt; 00:22:53,720

<p>356
00:22:53,800 &ndash;&gt; 00:22:56,120
- I think we need a jacket here.
- Mmm.</p>

<p>357
00:22:56,200 &ndash;&gt; 00:22:59,840
<i>And then cerulean quickly showed up
in the collections of eight different designers.</i></p>

<p>358
00:22:59,960 &ndash;&gt; 00:23:03,040
<i>And then it, uh, filtered down
through the department stores&hellip;</i></p>

<p>362
00:23:10,240 &ndash;&gt; 00:23:12,800
<i>However, that blue represents
millions of dollars&hellip;</i></p>

<p>364
00:23:15,360 &ndash;&gt; 00:23:18,280

that you&rsquo;ve made a choice&hellip;</p>

<p>365

for you by the people in this room&hellip;</p>

<p>378

00:27:01,000 &ndash;&gt; 00:27:03,240
I wrote those e-mails.</p>

<p>439
00:27:03,360 &ndash;&gt; 00:27:06,520
I&rsquo;m just trying to understand why someone
who got accepted to Stanford Law&hellip;</p>

<p>440
00:27:06,600 &ndash;&gt; 00:27:10,240

Dad, you have to trust me.</p>

Being Miranda&rsquo;s assistant
opens a lot of doors.</p>

<p>443
00:27:16,200 &ndash;&gt; 00:27:19,640
Emily is going to Paris
with Miranda in a few months&hellip;</p>

<p>444
00:27:19,720 &ndash;&gt; 00:27:23,360
and she&rsquo;s gonna meet editors and writers
from every important magazine.</p>

<p>445
00:27:23,480 &ndash;&gt; 00:27:25,360
And in a year, that could be me.</p>

<p>446
00:27:25,440 &ndash;&gt; 00:27:27,840
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>447

Of course not. Could I do that?</p>
