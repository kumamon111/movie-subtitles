### Chapter 6



 Excuse me.
 [Horn Honks]



 Welcome to the St. Regis.
May I assist you with anything?
 Oh. Yes.



 Uh I'm meeting someone at the King Cole Bar.
 Right this way.


  
Hi.



 You have one hour.
 Thank you.



One copy. What are my twins
gonna do with that? Share?


  
Oh no I made two copies...



and had them covered reset and bound
so that they wouldn't look like manuscripts.



This is an extra copy to have on file.
You know just in case.



Well where are these fabulous copies?
I don't see them anywhere.


  
[Whistle Blows]



[Andy] They're with the twins
on the train on the way to Grandma's.


  
Is there anything else
I can do for you?



Mmmmm. That's all.



Okay.



[Door Opens]



 Hey.
 Hey. I went to Dean & Deluca.



Man they charge like
five dollars a strawberry there.



But I figure since you quit your job...



we should celebrate.



 Listen Nate.
 Wait a minute.


  
You quit your job but you're still working
on the twins' science project?



Well that's big of you.



Okay after we talked I realized...



it doesn't make sense throwing away
all those months ofhard work.



I just had a moment of weakness
that's all.



Yeah well either that
or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.



All right. Whatever. It's your job.



Nate.


  
Come on.



I'm still the same person I was.



I still want the same things. Okay?



 Mmhmm.
 I promise. Same Andy better clothes.


  
 [Giggles]
 I like the old clothes.



Really?



Well what about these necklaces?
Do you like them?



No? And this dress it's new.



Eh.



Well there is one other thing
that's new...



that I thought you might like.



But uhWhat about this?



You don't like it.
I should better do



No no no no.



[Woman Singing]



[Ends]



Is this number two look?
This is number two?


  
 Hi.
 Hi. All right. Turn around for me darling.



Oh I get it. I get it. I get it.


  
The piece is called "urban jungle"right?



Yes the modern woman unleashes
the animal within to take on the big city.


  
[Growls]
Good. Go.



[Sighs] Sometimes I can't believe
I talk about this crap all day.



 Bobby come here. Let me see.
 Oh thank you.



 Make sure Miranda gets these as soon as possible.
 Mmhmm.



And tell her I switched in the Dior
for the Rocha.



 Oh great. Can't wait.
 Excuse me.



 Can we adjust the attitude?
 I'm sorry.



 Don't make me feed you to one of the models.
 I'm sorry.



It's a busy day.



My personal life
is hanging by a thread that's all.



Join the club. That's what happens
when you start doing well at work darling.



Let me know when your whole life
goes up in smoke.



That means it's time for a promotion.



No. All right February
back of the issue.



Did anybody speak
with Salma's people yet?



Yes but she'd rather do a summer cover
because she has a movie coming out.



No. Also I'm pulling the Toobin piece
on the Supreme Court women



woman.



And I need to see a new draft
on that piece...



about shopping for a plastic surgeon
It's dull.



And this layout
for the Winter Wonderland spread.



Not wonderful yet.



Oh okay. LI'll look at it.



What about Testino?
Where are we on that?



Zac Posen's doing
some very sculptural suits.


  
So I suggested that uh Testino
shoot them at the Noguchi Garden.



Perfect.



Thank God somebody came to work today.



What about accessories for April?


  
One thought I had was enamel.
Um bangles pendants earrings.


  
No. We did that two years ago.
What else?



Um well they're showing a lot of florals
right now so I was thinking



Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.



But we thought about shooting them
in an industrial space.



We thought the contrast
between the femininity of the florals...



and the more raw roughhewn background
would create this wonderful tension between


  
 No.
 Which?



 No.
 Which?



 [Emily Coughing]
 No.



[Coughing Continues]



Does anybody else
have anything I can possibly use?



Antibacterial wipes perhaps?



[Groans]


  
 How's the cold doing?
 Like death warmed up actually.


  
[Sniffles]
Oh God.



It's the benefit tonight.
I've been looking forward to it for months.


  
I refuse to be sick.
I'm wearing Valentino for crying out loud.


  
Right. Well everybody will
be leaving soon to get ready...


  
so I suggest you go and drop Miranda's
Fendi bag off at the showroom...



and then I suppose you can just go home.



Yeah? Oh well that is great.
Perfect actually.



I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before it closes.
It's Nate's birthday tonight.



So we're uh
having a little party for him.


  
Yeah I'm hearing this
and I wanna hear this.



Bye.



I love my job.
I love my job. I love my job.


  
[Chattering]



[Cell Phone Rings]



Hello?


  
Before the benefit tonight
I need to make sure...



that you're both fully prepped
on the guest list.



But I thought that only
the first assistant went to the benefit.


  
Only when the first assistant
hasn't decided to become...



an incubus of viral plague.



You'll come and help Emily.



 That's all.
 Right.



These are all of the guests.
Miranda invites everyone.



We have to make sure that they all think
she knows exactly who they are.


  
And I've been studying for weeks.



I have to learn all these by tonight?



No don't be silly Andrea.
These too.



Look you better just start without me okay?
I'll get there as soon as I can.


  
Andy come on it's his birth


  
Okay but hurry.


  
Oh please believe me I will.
This is the last thing that I wanna



Ooh I love that. Uh I'll call you
the second I'm leaving okay?



 Will that fit me?
 Oh yeah.



A little Crisco and some fishing line
and we're in business.



[Sarcastic Chuckle]


  
[Woman Singing]


  
Well nothing really. I mean this is


  
I mean really this is
the social event of the season.


  
[Continues]


  
Oh oh my God.

Oh thanks Em. You look so thin.


  
 Do I?
 Yeah.


  
Oh it's for Paris.
I'm on this new diet.


  
It's very effective.
Well I don't eat anything.


  
And then when I feel like I'm about to faint
I eat a cube of cheese.


  
 Well it's definitely working.
 I know.


  
I'm just one stomach flu
away from my goal weight.


  
[Man Singing]

artistic director of the Chelsea Rep.
