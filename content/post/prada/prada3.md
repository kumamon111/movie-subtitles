### Chapter 3


 [Bell Dings]
 Mr. Ravitz.


Nigel.


 Issue going well?
 Oh, yes. Our best September ever.


Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets
and pulled up the Sedona shoot.


What's that costing me?


About ,.


Must have been some lousy jackets.


 Irv Ravitz.
 Oh, I'm sorry.


This is Andy Sachs,
Miranda's new assistant.


Congratulations, young lady.


A million girls would kill for that job.


Byebye.


 Hmm?
 Chairman of EliasClarke, Irv Ravitz.


You know what they say?
Tiny man, huge ego.


No. And I've seen all this before.


Theyskens is trying to reinvent
the drop waist, so actually it's


 Where are all the other dresses?
 We have some right here.


 Stand, watch and listen.
 And I think it can be very interesting


No. No, I just
It's just <a name="a">baffling</a>to me.


Why is it so impossible
to put together a decent runthrough?


You people have had hours and hours
to prepare. It's just so confusing to me.


Where are the advertisers?


 We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
 We need more, don't we?


 Oh. This isThis might be
What do you think of
 Yeah.


Well, you know me.


Give me a full ballerina skirt
and a hint of <a name="b">saloon</a> and <a name="c">I'm on board.</a>


 But do you think it's too much like
 Like the Lacroix from July?


I thought that, but no, not with
the right accessories. It should work.


Where are the belts for this dre
Why is no one ready?


Here. It's a <a name="d">tough call.</a>


 They're so different.
 [Miranda] Hmm.


[Snorts, Chuckles]


Something funny?


No. No, no. Nothing's


You know, it's just that both those belts
look exactly the same to me.


You know, I'm still learning
about this stuff and, uh


"This... stuff"?


Oh. Okay. I see.


You think this has nothing
to do with you.


You go to your closet...


and you select I don't know
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...


because you're trying to tell the world
that you take yourself too seriously...


to care about what
you put on your back.


But what you don't know
is that that sweater is not just blue.


It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.


It's actually cerulean.


And you're also blithely unaware
of the fact...


that in , Oscar de la Renta
did a collection of cerulean gowns.


And then I think it was
Yves Saint Laurent wasn't it


who showed cerulean military jackets?


 I think we need a jacket here.
 Mmm.


And then cerulean quickly showed up
in the collections of eight different designers.


And then it, uh, filtered down
through the department stores...


and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...


and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...


where you, no doubt,
fished it out of some clearance bin.


However, that blue represents
millions of dollars...


and countless jobs...


and it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice...


that exempts you
from the fashion industry...


when, in fact...


you're wearing a sweater that was selected
for you by the people in this room...


from a pile of stuff.


So then I said,
"No, I couldn't see the difference...


between the two
absolutely identical belts"...


and you should have seen
the look she gave me!


I thought the flesh
was gonna melt off her face.


 [Chuckles]
 It's not funny.


She's not happy unless everyone around her
is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.


And the Clackers just worship her.


 The who?
 They call them Clackers.


The sound that their stilettos make
in the marble lobby.


It's like,
"Clack, clack, clack. Clack, clack."


[Groans] And they all act like
they're curing cancer or something.


[Chuckling]
The amount of time and energy...


that these people spend on these insignificant,
minute details, and for what?


So that tomorrow they can spend
another $, reshooting something...


that was probably fine to begin with...


to sell people things they don't need!


God!


 I'm not even hungry anymore.
 What?


 That is why those girls are so skinny.
 Oh. No, no, no.


Give me that. There's, like,
eight dollars ofJarlsberg in there.


[Sighs]
You know what?


I just have to <a name="e">stick it out</a> for a year.
One year.


And then I can do
what I came to New York to do.


But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.


Easy there, tiger.


 Oh, good morning, Miranda.
 Get me Isaac.


I don't see my breakfast here.
Are my eggs here? Where are my eggs?


Excuse me!


Pick up the Polaroids
from the lingerie shoot.


Have the brakes checked on my car.


 [Truck Horn Honking]
 [Gasps]


Where's that piece of paper
I had in my hand yesterday morning?


The girls need new surfboards or
boogie boards or something for spring break.


 Hello.
 The twins also need flipflops.


 Ow!
 Oh, my gosh!


Pick up my shoes from Blahnik,
and then go get Patricia.


 Who's that?
 Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!


Get me that little table
that I liked at that store on Madison.


Get us a reservation for dinner tonight
at that place that got the good review.


 Get me Isaac.
 Thirtysix thankyou notes delivered today.


 Where is everyone?
 Why is no one working?


[Miranda's Voice Overlapping]


Get me Demarchelier.


I have Miranda Priestly calling for
Okay.


I have Patrick.


[Sighs]
Thank God it's Friday, right?


At least Miranda will be in Miami,
so we don't have to be on call this weekend.


You know,
my dad's coming in from Ohio.


Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner,
maybe see Chicago.


You doing anything fun this weekend?


Yes.


[Piano]


[Andy]
Yeah, Nate said it was great.


He actually He applied here, but they
wanted someone with more experience.


 Here.
 Huh? What's this?


I don't want you
to get behind on your rent.


 Dad, how did you
 It's


I'm gonna kill Mom.
[Chuckles]


Dad, thank you.


Mmhmm.


 It's really good to see you.
 You too, honey.


So, you want to
start grilling me now...


or should we wait till after dinner?


I thought I'd let you at least enjoy
the bread basket first.


No, no, no. It's okay.
Go right ahead.


We're just a little worried, honey.


We get emails from you
at your office at : a.m.


Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.


Hey, that's not fair.


I wrote those emails.


I'm just trying to understand why someone
who got accepted to Stanford Law...


turns it down to be a journalist,
and now you're not even doing that.


Dad, you have to trust me.


Being Miranda's assistant
opens a lot of doors.


Emily is going to Paris
with Miranda in a few months...


and she's gonna meet editors and writers
from every important magazine.


And in a year, that could be me.


 All right?
 Mmhmm.


Dad, I swear, this is my break.


 This is my my chance.
 [Cell Phone Ringing]


This is my boss.


 I'm sorry, Dad. I have to take this.
 Take it. Take it.


 Hello. Miranda?
 My flight has been canceled.


It's some absurd weather problem.


I need to get home tonight. The twins have
a recital tomorrow morning at school.


 What?
 At school!


 Absolutely. Let me see what I can do.
 Good.


Hi. Um, I know this
is totally last minute...


but I was hoping that you
could maybe get a flight for my boss...


from Miami to New York tonight?


Uh


 [Dad] It's right here. Thank you.
 [Andy] Yeah, any kind ofjet.


 From Miami to New York.
 Thank you.


 Yup, I need it tonight. I need it
 Ow!


 I thought you were going out the other
 Sweetie! No.


 It's over here, honey.
 Tonight.


Hi. I'm trying to get a flight tonight
for tonight from Miami to New York.


Yes, I know there's a hurricane.


Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing is flying out?


It's for Miranda Priestly,
and I know that she's a client of yours.


Yes. Yes, hi. I need a jet tonight
from Miami to New York.


Yeah. Sorry. Hold on.
Hello? Miranda, hi.


I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one
is flying out because of the weather.


Please. It's just
I don't know <a name="#f">drizzling.</a>


 [Thunderclap]
 Someone must be getting out.


Call Donatella. Get her jet.


Call everybody else
that we know that has a jet. Irv?


Call every This is your responsibi
This is yourjob.


Get me home.


Oh, my God!
She's going to murder me.


What does she want you to do, call the National
Guard and have her airlifted out of there?


Of course not. Could I do that?


Come on.


Come on.
