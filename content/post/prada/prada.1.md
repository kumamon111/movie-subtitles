### Chapter 1

Hi. Uh, I have an appointment
with Emily Charlton?

Andrea Sachs?

Yes.

Great. Human Resources certainly
has an odd sense of humor.

Follow me.


Okay, so I was Miranda's
second assistant...


but her first assistant recently got promoted,
and so now I'm the first.


 Oh, and you're replacing yourself.
 Well, I am trying.


Miranda sacked the last two girls
after only a few weeks.


We need to find someone who can survive here.
Do you understand?


Yeah. Of course. Who's Miranda?


Oh, my God. I will pretend
you did not just ask me that.


She's the editor in chief of Runway,
<a name="nottomention">not to mention a legend.</a>

You work a year for her, and you can
get a job at any magazine you want.


<a name="a">A million girls would kill for this job.</a>


It sounds like a great opportunity.
I'd love to be considered.


[Giggling]


Andrea,
Runway is a fashion magazine...


so an interest in fashion is crucial.


What makes you think
I'm not interested in fashion?


[Cell Phone Ringing]
Oh, my God.


No! No! No!


What's wrong?


She's on her way. Tell everyone!


She's not supposed to be here
until :.


Her driver just text messaged,
and her facialist ruptured a disk.


 God, these people!
 [Whistles, Whispers] Who's that?


That I can't even talk about.


All right, everyone! Gird your loins!


 [Excited Chattering]
 Did somebody eat an onion bagel?


[Exhales, Sniffs]


[Bell Dings]


Sorry, Miranda.


[Bell Dings]


Move it! Ooh!


I don't understand why it's so difficult
to confirm an appointment.


I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I actually did confirm last night.


Details of your incompetence
do not interest me.


Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl
that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.


I asked for clean, athletic, smiling.
She sent me dirty, tired and <a name="b">paunchy.</a>


And R.S.V.P. Yes
to the Michael Kors party.


I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30
and pick me up at 9:40 sharp.


[Whispers] : sharp.
Call Natalie at Glorious Foods,
tell her no for the the time.


No, I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes
filled with warm rhubarb compote.


Then call my exhusband and remind him the
parentteacher conference is at Dalton tonight.


Then call my husband, ask him to meet me
for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.


Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent
for that feature on the female paratroopers...


and they're all so deeply unattractive.


Is it impossible to find a lovely,
slender female paratrooper?


 No.
 Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.


Also, I need to see all the things that Nigel
has pulled for Gwyneth's second cover try.


I wonder if she's lost any
of that weight yet. Who's that?


Nobody. Um, uh


Human Resources sent her up about the new
assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.


But she's hopeless
and totally wrong for it.


Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself
because the last two you sent me...


were completely inadequate.


So send her in. That's all.


Right.


 She wants to see you.
 Oh! She does?


Move!


 This is foul. Don't let her see it. Go!
 That's


[Sighs]


Who are you?


Uh, my name is Andy Sachs.


I recently graduated
from Northwestern University.


And what are you doing here?
[Clears Throat]


Well, I think I could do a good job
as your assistant.


And, um


Yeah, I came to New York to be a journalist
and sent letters out everywhere...


and then finally got a call
from EliasClarke...


and met with Sherry
up at Human Resources.


Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.


 So you don't read Runway?
 Uh, no.


And before today,
you had never heard of me.


No.


And you have no style
or sense of fashion.


Well, um, I think that depends
on what you're


No, no. That wasn't a question.


Um, I was editor in chief
of the Daily Northwestern.


I also, um, won a national competition
for college journalists...


with my series on thejanitors'union,
which exposed the exploitation


That's all.


[Scoffs]


Yeah. You know, okay.


You're right. I don't fit in here.


I am not skinny or glamorous...


and I don't know that much
about fashion.


But I'm smart.


I learn fast
and I will work very hard.


I got the exclusive
on the Cavalli for Gwyneth...


but the problem is, with that huge
feathered headdress that she's wearing...


she looks like she's working
the main stage at the Golden Nugget.


Thank you for your time.


Who is that sad little person?


Are we doing a beforeandafter piece
I don't know about?


Brown and Law, please?
Thank you.


 Andrea.
 Hmm?


Wait. You got a job
at a fashion magazine?


 Mmhmm.
 What was it, a phone interview?


 [Woman] Wow.
 Don't be a jerk.


Miranda Priestly is famous
for being unpredictable.


Okay, Doug. How is it
that you know who she is and I didn't?


 I'm actually a girl.
 Oh!


 That would explain so much.
 [Doug] Look, seriously.


Miranda Priestly is a huge deal.
I bet a million girls would kill for that job.


Yeah, great.
The thing is I'm not one of them.


[Woman]
Look, you gotta start somewhere, right?


I mean,
look at this dump Nate works in.


I mean, come on.
Paper napkins? Hello.


Yeah. And Lily, she works at that gallery
doing, uh, you know


Oh, I'm sorry. What exactly is it
that you do anyway?


Well, lucky for me,
I already have my dream job.


[With Lily]
You're a corporate research analyst!


 Oh, you're right. My job sucks.
 No!


 It sucks. I don't It's boring.
 It's all right. Breathe.


 I'm trying.
 Here. Take a drink.


 I will have a drink. I will have a drink.
 Ah, yes.


 I'd like to propose a toast.
 To jobs that pay the rent.
 To jobs that pay the rent.


[Lily]
<a name="d">Jobs that pay the rent.</a>


Oh, baby. You should see the way
these girls at Runway dress.


I don't have a thing to wear to work.


Come on. You're gonna be
answering phones and getting coffee.


You need a ball gown for that?


I think I might.


Well, I happen to think
you look great always.


Aww! I think you're full of it.


[Giggling]


 Hey. Come on. Let's go home.
 Yeah.


I can think of something we can do
that doesn't require any clothing.


 Really?
 Mmm.
