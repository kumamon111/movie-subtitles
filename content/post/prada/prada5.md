### Chapter 5



Emily?



Call James Holt's office. Tell them I want
to move the preview up to today at .


  
Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.



But we're not expected until Tuesday.
Did she say why?



Yes. Yeah she explained every detail
of her decision making.



And then we brushed each other's hair
and gabbed about American Idol.



I see your point.



 [Andy] What's a preview anyway?
 Good morning Miranda.



[Nigel] Miranda insists upon seeing
all the designers'collections...



before they show them.


  
 Great to see you.
 Hello James.



 [Andy] And she tells them what she thinks?
 [Nigel] In her way.



Uh this season really began for me
with a meditation...



on the intersection
between East and West.



[Nigel] There's a scale.
One nod is good. Two nods is very good.



There's only been one actual smile on record
and that was Tom Ford in .



An obi belt.



[Nigel]
She doesn't like it she shakes her head.



This is the dress that we have designed
specifically and exclusively for you.



[Nigel] Then of course
there's the pursing of the lips.



[Andy]
Which means?



[Nigel]
Catastrophe.



[Whispers]
Just uhJust go.


  
 I just don't understand. I'm appalled.
 It's absurd. Appalled.


  
 You deal with it.
 I'll talk to him.


  
So because she pursed her lips
he's gonna change his entire collection?



You still don't get it do you?



Her opinion is the only one
that matters.


  
 Call my husband and confirm dinner.
 At Pastis? Done.


  
And I'll need a change of clothes.



Well I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.



Fine. And Andrea I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.



 Have Emily give you the key.
 Mmhmm.



 Guard this with your life.
 Of course.


  
You know if I can deliver the Book
that means I must have done something right.



I'm not a psycho.



Oh and you know
she called me Andrea?



I mean she didn't call me Emily
which is Isn't that great?


  
Yeah whoopee. Right.



Now it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.



Oh. Okay.



[Emily]
The Book is assembled by  ...



and you must wait around for it
until then.


  
You will be delivering Miranda's
dry cleaning with the Book.


  
Now the car will take you straight
to Miranda's townhouse.



You let yourself in.



Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.



Do not look at anyone.



This is of the utmost importance.
You must be invisible.



 Do you understand?
 Uhhuh.



You open the door
and you walk across the foyer.



You hang the dry cleaning
in the closet across from the staircase.



 Uh
 And you leave the Book
on the table with the flowers.



[Panting]



 Shit!
 [Girl] It's that door to the left.



Okay.



[Whispers]
Thank you.



 You can give the Book to us.
 Shh. WhichWhich table?



 It's okay. Come on up.
 No I can't. I can't.


  
 What? It's okay.
 Come on.



 Yeah come on. It's okay.
 Please stop talking.



Or you can bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.



She does? Right.
She does all the time.



Yeah? Okay.



[Giggling]



[Miranda] What did you expect me to do
walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?


  
[Man] I rushed out of
an investment committee meeting...


  
and I sat there waiting for you
for almost an hour.



I told you the cell phones didn't work.
Nobody could get a signal out.



[Man] I knew what everyone
in that restaurant was thinking


  
there he is waiting for her again.



 Okay okay! Okay okay.
 Oh no. Shh!



It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.



The twins said hello
so I said hello back.


  
 Then I went up the stairs
to give her the Book and
 You went upstairs?



Oh my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed
with her and ask for a bedtime story?


  
Okay I made a mistake. I know.


  
Andrea you don't understand.



If you get fired
that might jeopardize Paris for me.



If that happens I will search every Blimpie's
in the tristate area until I track you down.


  
She's gonna fire me?



I don't know. She's not happy.



[Miranda]
Andrea?



[Snaps Fingers]



Miranda about last night l



I need the new Harry Potter book
for the twins.



Okay. Okay. I'll go down
to Barnes & Noble right now.



Did you fall down and smack
your little head on the pavement?


  
Not that I can recall.



We have all the published Harry Potter books.
The twins want to know what happens next.



You want the unpublished manuscript?


  
We know everyone in publishing.
It shouldn't be a problem should it?



And you can do anything right?


  
[Cell Phone Rings]



Yes Bobbsey. I know baby.


  
Mommy's working very hard
to get it for you.



She doesn't get it.



I could call frickin'J.K. Rowling herself.
I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.


  
My girls are leaving on the train
for their grandmother's at ...


  
so the book better be here
no later than .


  
 Of course!
 And I would like my steak here in  minutes.



No problem!
[Panting]


  
Okay. I have four hours
to get the impossible manuscript.



Smith & Wollensky's doesn't open until .
How am I gonna get the steak?



Okay. I will be back in  minutes.



 Wish me luck!
 No. Shan't.


  
Yes yes yes yes. I've been on hold.
It's for Miranda Priestly.


  
It's very important.



Yes I know it's impossible to get...



but well I was wondering if you
could make the impossible possible...


  
if that's at all possible.
[Laughing]


  
Yes I'm calling about
the Harry Potter manuscript.


  
Uh no. Unpublished.


  
Not a chance?



Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.


  
'Cause I think it makes a difference.


  
Let me call you back.


  
You probably don't remember me.
We met atJames Holt's party.



I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.


  
The Harry Potter manuscript?
Oh you're kidding.


  
Uh sorry to ask but I'm desperate.


  
Just tell her it can't be done.
You'll have to come up with a Plan "B."


  
Well this is Miranda Priestly
we're talking about.


  
There is no Plan "B."
There's only Plan "A."


  
Is she back? Am I fired?


  
I rarely say this to people
who aren't me...


  
but you have got to calm down.


  
Bloody hell!


  
Coat bag.


  
What's that? Oh I don't want that.
I'm having lunch with Irv.


  
I'll be back at .
I'd like my Starbucks waiting.


  
Oh and if you don't have
that Harry Potter book by then...


  
don't even bother coming back.



[Phone Rings]



Hello.



Quit? Are you sure?



I failed.
She's gonna fire me anyway.



 I might as well beat her to the punch.
 Wow.



Andy good for you.
Congratulations. You're free.



 Yeah. Well listen I'll call you later.
 Okay.



 [Line Clicks Phone Rings]
 Hello.



I'm brilliant. No really.



 Monuments should be erected in my honor.
 You didn't.


  
Oh yes. A friend of a friend
does the cover art...



and she happens
to have the manuscript.


  
Oh no 'cause that would mean
that I actually did something right.



[Chuckles]
It's just Oh!



The thing is Christian I was just
