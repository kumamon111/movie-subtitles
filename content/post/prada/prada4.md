### 重要表現


### Chapter 4




  
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.


  
Everyone except me...


  
because sadly I was not there.


  
Miranda I'm so sorry.


  
Do you know why I hired you?


  
I always hire the same girl


  
stylish slender of course...


  
worships the magazine.


  
But so often they turn out to be


  
I don't know disappointing and um...


  
stupid.


  
So you with that impressive résumé...


  
and the big speech
about your socalled work ethic


  
I um I thought you
would be different.


  
I said to myself go ahead.


  
Take a chance.


  
Hire the smart fat girl.


  
[Clears Throat]
I had hope.


  
My God. I live on it.


  
Anyway you ended up
disappointing me more than um


  
more than any of the other silly girls.


  
Um I really did everything
I could think of.


  
 Uh
 That's all.


  
Excuse me!
Where do you think you're going?


  
She hates me Nigel.


  
And that's my problem because


  
Oh wait. No it's not my problem.


  
I don't know what else I can do because
if I do something right it's unacknowledged.


  
She doesn't even say thank you.


  
But if I do something wrong
she is vicious.


  
 So quit.
 What?


  
 Quit.
 Quit?


  
I can get another girl to take your job
in five minutes one who really wants it.


  
No I don't want to quit.
That's not fair.


  
But you know I'm just saying
that I would just like a little credit...


  
for the fact
that I'm killing myself trying.


  
Andy be serious.


  
You are not trying.


  
 You are whining.
 L


  
What is it that you want me
to say to you huh?


  
Do you want me to say "Poor you.
Miranda's picking on you. Poor you. Poor Andy"?


  
Hmm? Wake up six.


  
She's just doing herjob.


  
Don't you know that you
are working at the place...


  
that published some
of the greatest artists of the century?


  
Halston Lagerfeld de la Renta.


  
And what they did what they created...


  
was greater than art
because you live your life in it.


  
Well not you obviously
but some people.


  
You think
this is just a magazine hmm?


  
This is not just a magazine.


  
This is a shining beacon of hope for


  
oh I don't know


  
let's say a young boy growing up
in Rhode Island with six brothers...


  
pretending to go to soccer practice
when he was really going to sewing class...


  
and reading Runway under the covers
at night with a flashlight.


  
You have no idea how many legends
have walked these halls.


  
And what's worse you don't care.


  
Because this place where so many
people would die to work...


  
you only deign to work.


  
And you want to know why
she doesn't kiss you on the forehead...


  
and give you a gold star on your homework
at the end of the day.


  
Wake up sweetheart.


  
[Sighs]


  
 Okay. So I'm screwing it up.
 Mmm.


  
I don't want to.


  
I just wish that I knew
what I could do to


  
 [Sighs] Nigel?
 Hmm?


  
Nigel Nigel.


  
No.


  
I don't know what you expect me to do.


  
There's nothing in this whole closet
that'll fit a size six.


  
I can guarantee you.


  
These are all sample sizes
two and four.


  
 All right. We're doing this for you. And
 A poncho?


  
You'll take what I give you
and you'll like it.


  
 We're doing this Dolce for you.
 Hmm!


  
And shoes.


  
 Jimmy Choo's.
 Hmm.


  
 Manolo Blahnik.
 Wow.


  
Nancy Gonzalez. Love that.


  
Okay Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love.


  
 Uh it might fit. It might.
 What?


  
Okay. Now Chanel. You're in desperate
need of Chanel. Darling shall we?


  
We have to get to the beauty department
and God knows how long that's going to take.


  
[Groans]


  
I mean I have no idea
why Miranda hired her.


  
Me neither. The other day
we were in the beauty department.


  
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler
and said "What is this?"


  
[Laughing]


  
I just knew
from the moment I saw her...


  
she was going to be
a complete and utter disas


  
 [Phone Rings]
 Miranda Priestly's office.


  
No actually she's not available
but I'll leave word.


  
Okay thanks. Bye.
[Clears Throat]


  
How did
[Grunts]


  
 Are you wearing the
 The Chanel boots?


  
Yeah I am.


  
You look good.


  
 Oh God.
 What?


  
 She does.
 Oh shut up Serena.


  
 See you guys tomorrow.
 Good night man. Take it easy.


  
Take care of that finger huh?


  
So what do you think?


  
Uh I think we better get out of here...


  
before my girlfriend sees me.


  
[Woman Singing]


  
 [Continues]
 [Horn Honking]


  
[Continues]


  
[Cell Phone Rings]


  
 [Continues]
 The gowns are fabulous.


  
Mmhmm.
We're gonna use the burgundy.


  
 Gotta find
 [Ends]


  
So we spent a whole semester
on potatoes alone.


  
You take the fry and squeeze it.


  
 See how firm that is?
 Hey. Oh I'm so sorry I'm late.


  
There was a crisis
in the accessories department.


  
 I needed to find a python headband.
 Python's hot right now.


  
I have exciting presents for all of you.


  
Are you ready?


  
 What is that?
 It's a Bang & Olufsen phone.


  
Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda
for her birthday.


  
I looked it up on line.
It's $.


  
 What?
 Wow!


  
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.


  
 A little Clinique.
 Ooh!


  
 Oh damn it. I love your job.
 Oh.! One more.


  
 A little thing.
 [Gasps]


  
 Do you want it? You want Oh.
 Gimme! Gimme gimme gimme!


  
 I think she likes it.
 Oh my God! This is the new MarcJacobs!


  
This is sold out everywhere.
Where did you get this?


  
Miranda didn't want it so


  
No no no no no. This bag is like $.
I cannot take this from you.


  
 [Cackles]
 Yeah you can.


  
 Why do women need so many bags?
 Shut up.


  
You have one. You put all your junk in it
and that's it. You're done.


  
Fashion is not about utility.


  
An accessory is merely
a piece of iconography...


  
used to express individual identity.


  
 Oh! And it's pretty.
 That too.


  
Yeah. But the thing is it turns out there is
more to Runway than just fancy purses.


  
Look here's an essay byJay Mclnerney
a piece byJoan Didion.


  
Even an interview
with Christiane Amanpour.


  
 Looks like someone's been drinking the KoolAid.
 What do you


  
 [Cell Phone Ringing]
 I got it. It'sYup the Dragon Lady.


  
 Oh Miranda?
 Let me talk to her.


  
 I need that.
 I'll tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.


  
Lily no no no! Put that thing up!
I was gonna answer it!


  
It's gonna make
Give me the... phone.


  
[Beeps]


  
 [Sputters]
 Hi Miranda.


  
 Ooh. Shh.
 Absolutely.


  
 Shh!
 Uhhuh. I'm leaving right now.


  
You know you guys
didn't have to be such assholes.


  
[Rings]


  
[Electronica]


  
[Woman Singing]


  
Um excuse me.


  
I'm looking forJames Holt.


  
Um that's him right there.


  
 Oh. Thanks.
 No problem.


  
 I put my stuff out there and I pray they improve.
 Really?


  
 Excuse me.
 Hi.


  
I'm Andy.
I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.


  
Oh yes.
You must be the new Emily.

finished with a metallic fringe.


  
[Clicks Tongue] Very nice indeed.

You.


  
Hmm. Duh. This way.


  
Uh here we go.


  
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress
for the benefit.


  
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection.
Top secret stuff.


  
 I'll guard it with my life.
 Please do.


  
Come on.
You're working for Miranda Priestly now.


  
You must be in desperate need
of hard liquor.


  
Excuse us girls.


  
She'll have the punch.


  
[Clears Throat]


  
It's deadly. Have fun.


  
[Man Singing]


  
 He's right you know.
 Hmm?


  
The punch.
I drank it atJames's last party.


  
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing
but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

Oh. Well I want to work for somewhere
like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.


  
 I am a writer too.
 Is that right?


  
 Mmhmm.

Why don't you send it over?


  
Yeah?


  
That would beThank you.

But actually right now I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.
