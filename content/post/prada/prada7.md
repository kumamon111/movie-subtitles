 Look at you.
 Hello.


  
You'reYou're a vision.


  
 Oh. [Scoffs]
 Thank God I saved your job.


  
[Stammers Chuckles] You know
I figured out a few things on my own too.


  
Turns out
I'm not as nice as you thought.


  
I hope not.


  
Well if it weren't
for the stupid boyfriend...


  
I'd have to whisk you away
right here and now.


  
 Do you actually say things like that to people?
 Evidently.


  
[Giggles]
Well I gotta go.


  
Are you sure? 'Cause my editor
for New York Magazine is inside...


  
and you know
I could introduce you two.


  
 You sent over your stuff
for me to look at? Remember?
 Yeah.


  
All right I gotta admit I only read a couple.
It was a very large packet you sent.


  
 Yeah.
 But what I did read wasn't half bad.


  
And you know I think
I think you have a talent Andy.


  
He should meet you.


  
Why don't you come in?
Just for one drink.


  
Um okay yeah.
I guess I could for one


  
No I can't.
I'm sorry but I have to go.


  
All right.
Give my best to the boyfriend.


  
Roy I'm sorry.
Can you go any faster?


  
I'm sure Nate will understand.


  
Yeah.


  
[TV Indistinct]


  
Hey.


  
Happy birthday.


  
Nate I'm so sorry.


  
I kept trying to leave
but there was a lot going on.


  
And you know I didn't have a choice.


  
Don't worry about it.


  
[Grunts]
I'm gonna go to bed.


  
Can we at least talk about this?


  
You look really pretty.


  
[Miranda]
Andrea?


  
 Do you have the Book?
 Oh. Uh


  
Mm.


  
Paris is the most important week
of my entire year.


  
I need the best possible team with me.


  
That no longer includes Emily.


  
Wait. You want me to


  
No Miranda.


  
[Exhales]
Emily would die.


  
Her whole life is about Paris.


  
She hasn't eaten in weeks.
LI can't... do that.


  
Miranda I can't.


  
If you don't go I'll assume you're
not serious about your future...


  
at Runway or any other publication.


  
The decision's yours.


  
That's all.


  
[Woman Singing]


  
[Laughing]


  
[Continues]


  
 [Continues]
 Hey Andy.


  
 Hey.
 You coming to bed anytime soon?


  
Uh yeah. Five minutes okay?


  
[Ends]


  
[Fax Printing]


  
[Clears Throat]


  
Andrea don't forget to tell Emily.


  
Do it now.


  
 [Line Ringing]
 Don't pick up.


  
 Don't pick up. Don't pick up. Don't pick
 Hi.


  
 Emily.
 Hi hi. Sorry I'm late.


  
It's just Miranda wanted
some scarves from Hermès.


  
And she did tell me yesterday
but I forgot like an idiot.


  
And so I freaked out of course.


  
Emily Emily lI need to talk to you.


  
I called Martine at home and she opened
the shop early. Whoa! I'm sorry.


  
She opened the shop early for me
so I got them which is great.


  
Okay. Um Emily
whwhen you come in...


  
there's something
I have to talk to you about.


  
 Well I hope it's not another Miranda problem.
 Not exactly.


  
Well good because I've got so much
to deal with before I go. I swear to God


  
 [Gasps]
 [Horn Honks Tires Skid]


  
 [Clamoring]
 [Woman] Oh my God.!


  
Emily?


  
[Woman On P.A. Indistinct]


  
[Elevator Bell Dings]


  
I don't care if she was gonna fire you
or beat you with a redhot poker!


  
You should have said no.


  
Emily I didn't have a choice.


  
 Oh. Please.
 You know how she is.


  
 That is a pathetic excuse.
 [Door Opens]


  
Thanks.


  
Do you know what really just...


  
gets me about this whole thing...


  
is that you know you're the one who said
you don't really care about this stuff.


  
And you don't really care about fashion.
You just wanna be a journalist.


  
What a pile of bollocks!


  
Emily I know you're mad.
I don't blame you.


  
Face it you sold your soul the day
you put on that first pair ofJimmy Choo's.


  
I saw it. And you know what really
just kills me about this whole thing...


  
is the clothes that you're gonna get.


  
I mean you don't deserve them.


  
You eat carbs for Christ's sake.


  
God it's so unfair.!


  
 Emily.
 Just go.


  
 Emily l
 I said go!


  
[Sighs]


  
 [Doug] You are going to Paris
for the couture shows?
 [Andy] Mmhmm.


  
 That's the coolest fashion event of the year.
 Mmhmm.


  
 I mean who are you going to see Galliano?
 Yeah.


  
 And Lagerfeld and Nicholas Ghesquiere.
 Yep.


  
 Yes. Okay now you're scaring me.
 [Chuckles]


  
 Hey.
 Hey.


  
 This show is amazing. I am so proud of you.
 [Lily] Thank you.


  
Okay start with the photos in the back
and work your way forward.


  
That is the way I designed it.
It is brilliant.


  
 You will love it.
 Of course.


  
And you I have somebody
I want you to meet okay?


  
Ooh art and sex. Lead the way.


  
 See you later.
 Okay.


  
[Woman Singing]


  
 [Continues]
 Hey. Hey Miranda girl.


  
 Hi.
 I was just thinking about you.


  
Oh come on.


  
 It's true.
 No.


  
I'm profiling Gaultier for Interview
and uh making my Paris plans.


  
I found myself wondering
if uh you were gonna be there.


  
Well actually um I am going.


  
Great. I'm staying in a fantastic
little hotel in the Seventh...


  
right across the street from the falafel
restaurant that will change your life.


  
[Chuckles]
I'm sorry. I'll be too busy working.


  
You'll have to find
someone else's life to change.


  
Well that's just it.


  
I'm beginning to wonder if I can.


  
Lily.


  
Lily he's just a guy I know from work.


  
 Yeah that looked like work.
 Look you're making a big deal out of


  
You know the Andy I know
is madly in love with Nate...


  
is always five minutes early...


  
and thinks I don't know
Club Monaco is couture.


  
For the last  years I've known
everything about that Andy.


  
But this person? This "glamazon"
who skulks around in corners...


  
with some random hot fashion guy?


  
I don't get her.


  
 Lily.
 Have fun in Paris.


  
You going to Paris?


  
Uh yeah. It just happened.


  
I thought Paris
was a big deal for Emily or


  
Great. Now you're gonna
give me a hard time too?


  
Hey Andy. Andy!


  
 Andy what the hell is wrong with you?
 LI didn't have a choice okay?


  
 Miranda asked me and I couldn't say no.
 I know.


  
That's your answer for everything lately
"I didn't have a choice."


  
 Like this job was forced on you.
 Nate I get it okay?


  
Like you don't make
these decisions yourself.


  
You're mad because I work late all the time
and I missed your birthday party.


  
 And I'm sorry.
 Oh come on. What am I four?


  
YouYou hate Runway
and Miranda.


  
And you think fashion is stupid.
You've made that clear.


  
Andy I make
port wine reductions all day.


  
I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps.


  
You know I wouldn't care if you were
out there pole dancing all night...


  
as long as you did it
with a little integrity.


  
You used to say this was just a job.


  
You used to make fun
of the Runway girls.


  
What happened?
Now you've become one of them.


  
 That's absurd.
 That's okay. That's fine. Just own up to it.


  
And then we can stop pretending like
we have anything in common anymore.


  
 You don't mean that do you?
 No I do.


  
Well...


  
maybe this trip
is coming at a good time.


  
Maybe we should take a break.


  
Nate?


  
[Cell Phone Ringing]


  
I'm sorry. Just... one second?


  
You know
in case you were wondering...


  
the person whose calls you always take
that's the relationship you're in.


  
I hope you two
are very happy together.


  
[Cell Phone Continues Ringing]


  
Hello Miranda.


  
[Man Singing]


  
[Continues]


  
[Continues]


  
[Ends]


  
[Chattering]


  
Pardon. Miranda.


  
 [Speaking Italian]
 Maestro. Mmm.


  
How are you? So glad to see you.
Thank you for coming.


  
 You like the collection?
 Absolutely. I think it's the best in years.


  
 This is very important for me.
Very very important.
 I'm very happy for you.


  
 This is my new Emily.
 Hello. How do you do?


  
 I'm good. Pleasure.
 Nice to meet you.


  
You love the show?


  
 Miranda. This way!
 [Clamoring]


  
Miranda. Nigel.
Fashion's great gatekeepers.


  
Miranda what is Runway's position
on French fashion versus American fashion?


  
 I've been thinking
 Oh.


  
 You still owe me for Harry Potter.
 Oh do I?


  
 Of course you do. Are you working tonight?
 Oh!


  
 No actually Miranda has a dinner.
 Great you're free.


  
Oh but there is the problem
of le boyfriend.


  
Wait don't tell me.
The boyfriend non plus?


  
Je suis trés trés desolé.


  
Oh you're so full of it.
You're not desolé at all.


  
No not even a little.
What time should I pick you up?


  
 Uh
 I'll call you.


  
Yeah.


  
Oh.


  
Oh there you are.
[Clears Throat]


  
We need to go over the seating
uh chart for the luncheon.


  
Okay. Um yeah sure.


  
I have it right here.


  
By all means move at a glacial pace.
You know how that thrills me.


  
Okay.


  
So...


  
first of all we need to move
Snoop Dogg to my table.


  
But your table's full.


  
Stephen isn't coming.


  
Oh Stephen is


  
So I don't need to fetch Stephen
from the airport tomorrow?


  
Well if you speak to him
and he decides to rethink the divorce...


  
then yes fetch away.


  
You're very fetching so go fetch.


  
And then when we get back to New York
we need to contact um...


  
Leslie to see what she can do
to minimize the press...


  
on all this.


  
Another divorce...


  
splashed across page six.


  
I can just imagine what they're
gonna write about me.


  
The Dragon Lady careerobsessed.


  
Snow Queen drives away
another Mr. Priestly.


  
Rupert Murdoch
should cut me a check...


  
for all the papers I sell for him.


  
Anyway I don't


  
I don't really care
what anybody writes about me.


  
But my my girls I just


  
It's just so unfair to the girls.


  
It's just...


  
another disappointment...


  
another letdown
another father... figure


  
[Chuckles]
Gone.


  
Anyway the point is
[Clears Throat]


  
The point is
[Sighs]


  
The point is we really need to
figure out where to place Donatella...


  
because she's barely
speaking to anyone.


  
I'm so sorry Miranda.


  
If you want me to cancel
your evening I can.


  
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would we do that?


  
Um is


  
Is there anything else I can do?


  
Your job.


  
That's all.


  
[Knocking]


  
Hi. I need Miranda's itinerary
for tomorrow.


  
 Okay. Come on in.
 All right? Thanks.


  
 Who put that together for you?
 This?


  
Oh it's just
it's just something I threw on.


  
Turn around. Let me see. Turn.


  
 Mm. Incroyable.
 Yeah?


  
 It's really just No it's No gorgeous.
 Yeah? Okay good.


  
Really. I think that
my work here is done.


  
Oh.


  
We're going to celebrate.
I'm going to get some champagne.


  
Okay. What are we toasting?


  
We are toasting my dear
to the dream job.


  
The one that a million girls wanted.


  
Which I got months ago.


  
I'm not talking about you.


  
Mmhmm.


  
 James Holt
 Yeah.


  
Massimo Corteleoni...


  
is investing in James's company
and taking it global.


  
 Mmhmm.
 Bags shoes fragrances the works.


  
And James needs a partner.


  
And that partner would be me.


  
 Does Miranda
 No no Miranda knows because


  
 Oh.
 Oh she put me up for it.
God no. Can you imagine?


  
But But But you're leaving.


  
 Mmhmm.
 I can't imagine Runway without you.


  
I know I know
but I'm so excited though.


  
This is the first time in  years I'm going
to be able to call the shots in my own life.


  
Oh my God.!


  
I'm going to be able to come to Paris
and actually see Paris.


  
Well congratulations.


  
 Huh? Oh.
 Nigel you deserve it.


  
You bet your sizesix ass.
[Guffaws]


  
 Four.
 Really?


  
 [Glasses Clink]
 Cheers.


  
 Cheers to you.
 To us.


  
 Let me see that.
 [Giggles]


  
[Woman Singing In French]


  
Okay I just wanna say that yes there are things
Miranda does that I don't agree with but


  
 Come on. You hate her. Just admit it to me.
 No.


  
She's a She's a notorious sadist...


  
and not not in a good way.


  
Okay she's tough
but if Miranda were a man...


  
no one would notice anything about her
except how great she is at her job.


  
[Chuckles]
I'm sorry. I can't


  
 I can't believe this. You're defending her?
 Yeah.


  
The wideeyed girl peddling
her earnest newspaper stories?


  
You my friend
are crossing over to the dark side.


  
I resent that.


  
 You shouldn't. It's sexy.
 Sexy?


  
 Really?
 Really.


  
So do you
do you know where we're going?


  
 'Cause I'm lost.
 Yeah.


  
Yeah don't worry. I know this city
like the back of my hand.


  
It's my favorite place
in the whole world.


  
You know Gertrude Stein once said...


  
"America is my country
and Paris is my hometown."


  
 [Laughs]
 It's true.


  
What do you do?


  
Do you just write stuff like that down...


  
and then file it away to use on us girls?


  
 I'm Christian Thompson. That's my way.
 That's your way. Right.


  
I work freelance.
I have a lot of free time on my hands.


  
You know I never understood...


  
why everyone was so crazy about Paris...


  
but... it is so beautiful.


  
[Giggles]


  
Mm. LI can't. I'm sorry.


  
I can't. You know Nate and I just split up
a couple days ago and I can't.


  
Ooh. I've had too much wine.


  
And my hearingvision
judgment's impaired.


  
No I barely know you.
I'm in a strange city.


  
I... am out of excuses.


  
Thank God.


  
[Groans]


  
[Gasps]


  
Yes.


  
Oh shoot.


  
[Door Opens]


  
Bonjour madame.


  
Uh what the hell is this?


  
What does it look like?
It's a mockup.


  
Yeah. Of?


  
Of what American Runway will look like
when Jacqueline Follet is the new editor in chief.


  
WhThey're replacing Miranda?


  
Yeah. And she's bringing me in
to run all the editorial content.


  
You're really surprised?


  
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.
She has a fresher take on things.


  
Not to mention American Runway's one
of the most expensive books in the business.


  
Jacqueline does the same thing
for a lot less money.


  
And Irv
Irv's a businessman you know.


  
Miranda will be devastated. Her whole life
is about Runway. He can't do that to her.


  
It's done. Irv's gonna tell Miranda
after the party forJames.


  
And she has no idea?


  
She's a big girl. She'll be fine.


  
Shi I have to go.


  
Andy.


  
Andy it's done.


  
Baby it's done.


  
I'm not your baby.


  
 [Phone Ringing]
 Allo.


  
Oh! Oh! Thank God you're there.


  
 [Sighs] Excuse me?
 I need to talk to you right away.


  
It's aboutJacqueline Follet.


  
Shit! Oh shit! Shit shit shit!


  
 Yes.
 Mr. Ravitz I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was wondering


  
Have you completely lost your mind?


  
 I need to talk to you.
 Do not disturb me again.


  
But um it's just for one Miranda!


  
[Horn Honks]


  
Miranda. Miranda.
Wait I need to talk to you.


  
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet
the editor in chief of Runway.


  
Christian Thompson told me
he's gonna work for her.


  
Irv is going to tell you today. I thought
maybe if I told you that you could fix it.


  
Do I smell freesias?


  
What? No.
LI specifically told them


  
If I see freesias anywhere...


  
I will be very disappointed.


  
For  years Runway
has been more than a magazine.


  
It has been a beacon
of elegance and grace.


  
Miranda Priestly is the finest
possible guardian of that beacon...


  
setting a standard that inspires
people across the globe.


  
Ladies and gentlemen
I give you Miranda Priestly.


  
Thank you my dear friend.


  
Bonjour.
[Chuckles]


  
Thank you very much
for coming today...


  
to help celebrate
our dear friend James Holt.


  
But before I talk to you aboutJames...


  
and his many accomplishments...


  
I would like first to share
some news with you.


  
Um as many of you know...


  
uh recently Massimo Corteleoni...


  
has agreed to finance the expansion
of theJames Holt label...


  
transforming the work
of this visionary artist...


  
into a global brand
which is really an exciting enterprise.


  
Runway and James Holt share
many things in common...


  
chief among them
a commitment to excellence.


  
And so it should come as no surprise
that when the time came...


  
forJames to choose the new president
ofJames Holt International...


  
he chose from within
the Runway family.


  
And it's my great happiness today...


  
to announce to you all
that that person...


  
is my friend
and longtime esteemed colleague...


  
Jacqueline Follet.


  
Thank you. Merci.


  
And now to the main event...


  
our celebration ofJames Holt.


  
We at Runway
are very proud to have been


  
When the time is right
she'll pay me back.


  
You sure about that?


  
No.


  
But I hope for the best.


  
I have to.


  
[Clamoring]


  
You thought I didn't know.


  
I've known what was happening
for quite some time.


  
Itjust took me a little while to find
a suitable alternative forJacqueline.


  
And thatJames Holtjob
was so absurdly overpaid...


  
that of course she jumped at it.


  
So I just had to tell Irv
thatJacqueline was unavailable.


  
The truth is there is no one
that can do what I do...


  
including her.


  
Any of the other choices would
have found that job impossible...


  
and the magazine would have suffered.


  
[Sighs]
Especially because of the list.


  
The list of designers photographers...


  
editors writers models all of whom
were found by me nurtured by me...


  
and have promised me
they will follow me...


  
whenever and if ever
I choose to leave Runway.


  
[Chuckles]


  
So he reconsidered.


  
But I was very very impressed...


  
by how intently you tried to warn me.


  
I never thought I would say this
Andrea...


  
but I really


  
I see a great deal of myself in you.


  
You can see beyond what people want
and what they need...


  
and you can choose for yourself.


  
I don't think I'm like that.


  
L


  
I couldn't do what you did to Nigel
Miranda.


  
I couldn't do something like that.


  
Mm. You already did.


  
To Emily.


  
That's not what l


  
No that was that was different.
I didn't have a choice.


  
Oh no you chose.
You chose to get ahead.


  
You want this life
those choices are necessary.


  
But what if this isn't what I want?


  
I mean what if I don't wanna
live the way you live?


  
Don't be ridiculous Andrea.
Everybody wants this.


  
Everybody wants to be us.


  
[Clamoring]


  
[Woman Vocalizing]


  
[Vocalizing Continues]


  
[Cell Phone Ringing]


  
[Vocalizing Continues]


  
I have to be at work in  minutes.


  
What's up?


  
Well I just


  
I wanted to say
that you were right about everything.


  
That...


  
I turned my back on my friends
and my family...


  
and everything I believed in...


  
and and for what?


  
For shoes and shirts
and jackets and belts.


  
Nate.


  
I'm sorry.


  
L
[Clears Throat]


  
I flew up to Boston while you were gone.


  
I interviewed at the Oak Room.


  
And?


  
And you're looking
at their new souschef.


  
 I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
 That's great. Congratulations.


  
I don't know what I'm gonna do without
those latenight grilled cheeses but


  
I'm pretty sure
they have bread in Boston.


  
May even haveJarlsberg.


  
We might be able
to figure something out.


  
You think?


  
Yeah.


  
So what about you?
I mean what are you gonna do now?


  
Actually I uh
I have a job interview today.


  
 Oh yeah?
 Mmhmm.


  
That's what you're wearing?


  
Shut up. I like this.


  
 Andy Greg Hill.
 Hello.


  
Come on. These clips are excellent.


  
This thing on the janitors' union
that's exactly what we do here.


  
My only question is Runway?


  
My only question is Runway?


  
You were there for less than a year.


  
What the hell kind of a blip is that?


  
Learned a lot.


  
In the end though
I kind of screwed it up.


  
I called over there for a reference
left word with some snooty girl.


  
Next thing you know I got a fax
from Miranda Priestly herself...


  
saying that of all the assistants
she's ever had...


  
you were by far
her biggest disappointment.


  
And if I don't hire you
I am an idiot.


  
You must have done something right.


  
 [Beeping]
 [Phone Ringing]


  
Miranda Priestly's office.


  
Hey Emily it's Andy. Don't hang up.
I have a favor to ask you.


  
You have a favor to ask of me?


  
Yeah. The thing is
I have all these clothes from Paris...


  
and I don't have anyplace
to wear them...


  
so I was wondering if you
could take them off my hands.


  
Well I don't know.
It's a huge imposition.


  
And I'll have to get them taken in.
I mean they'll drown me.


  
But I suppose I could help you out.
I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.


  
Thanks Em. I appreciate it.
Good luck.


  
You have some very large shoes to fill.


  
I hope you know that.


  
I don't understand
why it is so challenging...


  
to get my car when I ask for it.


  
[Chuckles]


  
Go.
