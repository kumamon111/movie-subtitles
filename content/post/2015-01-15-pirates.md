00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Hi. Uh, I have an appointment
with Emily Charlton?

14
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,000
- Andrea Sachs?
- Yes.

15
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
Great. Human Resources certainly
has an odd sense of humor.

16
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,440
Follow me.

17
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,520
Okay, so I was Miranda's
second assistant...

18
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
but her first assistant recently got promoted,
and so now I'm the first.

19
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,920
- Oh, and you're replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.

20
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,320
Miranda sacked the last two girls
after only a few weeks.

21
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,720
We need to find someone who can survive here.
Do you understand?

22
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,680
Yeah. Of course. Who's Miranda?

23
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,920
Oh, my God. I will pretend
you did not just ask me that.

<i>She's the editor in chief of Runway,
not to mention a legend.</i>

You work a year for her, and you can
get a job at any magazine you want.

A million girls would kill for this job.

27
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,800

I'd love to be considered.

<i>Andrea,
Runway is a fashion magazine...</i>

30
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,480
so an interest in fashion is crucial.

31
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,840

I'm not interested in fashion?

She's on her way. Tell everyone!

36

She's not supposed to be here
until 9:00.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,880
Her driver just text messaged,
and her facialist ruptured a disk.

- God, these people!
- [Whistles, Whispers] Who's that?

39
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,200

Move it! Ooh!

47
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
I don't understand why it's so difficult
to confirm an appointment.

48
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,680
I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I actually did confirm last night.

49
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,840
Details of your incompetence
do not interest me.

50
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,600
Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl
that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.

51
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,120
I asked for clean, athletic, smiling.
She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.

52
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
And R.S.V.P. Yes
to the Michael Kors party.

53
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,040
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30
and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.

54
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,200
- [Whispers] 9:45 sharp.
- Call Natalie at Glorious Foods,
tell her no for the 40th time.

55
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,280
No, I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes
filled with warm rhubarb compote.

56
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,560
Then call my ex-husband and remind him the
parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight.

57
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,920
Then call my husband, ask him to meet me
for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.

58
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,520
Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent
for that feature on the female paratroopers...

59
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,320
and they're all so deeply unattractive.

60
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,480
Is it impossible to find a lovely,
slender female paratrooper?

61
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,160
- No.
- Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.

62
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,960
<i>Also, I need to see all the things that Nigel
has pulled for Gwyneth's second cover try.</i>

63
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,800
<i>I wonder if she's lost any
of that weight yet. Who's that?</i>

64
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,080
Nobody. Um, uh-

65
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,360
Human Resources sent her up about the new
assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.

66
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,240
But she's hopeless
and totally wrong for it.

67
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,120
Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself
because the last two you sent me...

68
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,040
<i>were completely inadequate.</i>

69
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,400
So send her in. That's all.

70
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,520
Right.

71
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,440
- She wants to see you.
- Oh! She does?

72
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,400
Move!

73
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,880
- This is foul. Don't let her see it. Go!
- That's-

74
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,800
[Sighs]

75
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
Who are you?

76
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,880
Uh, my name is Andy Sachs.

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,840
I recently graduated
from Northwestern University.

78
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,560
And what are you doing here?
[Clears Throat]

79
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,920
Well, I think I could do a good job
as your assistant.

80
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,240
<i>And, um-</i>

81
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,400
Yeah, I came to New York to be a journalist
and sent letters out everywhere...

82
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
and then finally got a call
from Elias-Clarke...

83
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,320
<i>and met with Sherry
up at Human Resources.</i>

84
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,600
<i>Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.</i>

85
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,920
<i>- So you don't read Runway?
- Uh, no.</i>

86
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,400
<i>And before today,
you had never heard of me.</i>

87
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
No.

88
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,480
And you have no style
or sense of fashion.

89
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,160
Well, um, I think that depends
on what you're-

90
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,520
No, no. That wasn't a question.

91
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,760
<i>Um, I was editor in chief
of the Daily Northwestern.</i>

92
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,120
I also, um, won a national competition
for college journalists...

93

96
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,280
Yeah. You know, okay.

97
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,280
You're right. I don't fit in here.

98
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
I am not skinny or glamorous...

99
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,560
<i>and I don't know that much
about fashion.</i>

100
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
<i>But I'm smart.</i>

101
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,120
I learn fast
and I will work very hard.

102
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,600
I got the exclusive
on the Cavalli for Gwyneth...

103
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,920
but the problem is, with that huge
feathered headdress that she's wearing...

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,520
she looks like she's working
the main stage at the Golden Nugget.

105
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,200
Thank you for your time.

106
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,000
Who is that sad little person?

107
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,960
Are we doing a before-and-after piece
I don't know about?

108
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,600

Thank you.

- Hmm?

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,560
<i>Wait. You got a job
at a fashion magazine?</i>

111
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,560
- Mm-hmm.
- What was it, a phone interview?

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,960
<i>- [Woman] Wow.

114
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,000
<i>Okay, Doug. How is it
that you know who she is and I didn't?</i>

115
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,480

- Oh!

<i>- That would explain so much.

Miranda Priestly is a huge deal.
I bet a million girls would kill for that job.

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,200
Oh, I'm sorry. What exactly is it
that you do anyway?

I think I might.

the Sedona shoot from October.

<i>Okay. First of all,
you and I answer the phones.</i>

The phone must be answered

- What? No.

172

One time an assistant left the desk because
she sliced her hand open with a letter opener...

173

<i>and Miranda missed Lagerfeld...</i>

And, um, most importantly, um...

186
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,880
I get to go with her to Paris
for Fashion Week in the fall.

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000

Don't touch it. She returns it to us
in the morning with her notes.

195

Now, the second assistant
is supposed to do this...

196
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,840

and she does not like strangers in her house.

197

to prepare. It's just so confusing to me.</i>

327
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,040
Where are the advertisers?

328
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,120
- We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
- We need more, don't we?

329
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,000
- Oh. This is-This might be-
What do you think of-
- Yeah.

330
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,560
<i>Well, you know me.</i>

331
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,440
Give me a full ballerina skirt
and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.

332
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,840
<i>- But do you think it's too much like-
- Like the Lacroix from July?</i>

333
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,720
I thought that, but no, not with
the right accessories. It should work.

334
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,160
Where are the belts for this dre-
Why is no one ready?

335
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,440
Here. It's a tough call.

336
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,600
<i>- They're so different.
- [Miranda] Hmm.</i>

337
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,680
[Snorts, Chuckles]

338
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,320
Something funny?

339
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,600
No. No, no. Nothing's-

340
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,400
You know, it's just that both those belts
look exactly the same to me.

341
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,520
You know, I'm still learning
about this stuff and, uh-

342
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,280
"This... stuff"?

343
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,800
<i>Oh. Okay. I see.</i>

344
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,000
You think this has nothing
to do with you.

345
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,280
<i>You go to your closet...</i>

346
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,880
and you select- I don't know-
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...

347
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,720
<i>because you're trying to tell the world
that you take yourself too seriously...</i>

348
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,080
to care about what
you put on your back.

349
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
But what you don't know
is that that sweater is not just blue.

350
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,720
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.

351
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,880
It's actually cerulean.

352
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,960
And you're also blithely unaware
of the fact...

353
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,200
<i>that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta
did a collection of cerulean gowns.</i>

354
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,720
<i>And then I think it was
Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it-</i>

355
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,720
who showed cerulean military jackets?

356
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,120
- I think we need a jacket here.
- Mmm.

357
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,840
<i>And then cerulean quickly showed up
in the collections of eight different designers.</i>

358
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,040
<i>And then it, uh, filtered down
through the department stores...</i>

359
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,120
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

360
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,040
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

361
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,160
<i>where you, no doubt,
fished it out of some clearance bin.</i>

362
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,800
<i>However, that blue represents
millions of dollars...</i>

363
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,280
and countless jobs...

364
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,280
and it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice...

365
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,280
that exempts you
from the fashion industry...

366
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,200
when, in fact...

367
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,520
you're wearing a sweater that was selected
for you by the people in this room...

368
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,240
from a pile of stuff.

369
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,840
<i>So then I said,
"No, I couldn't see the difference...</i>

370
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,160
<i>between the two
absolutely identical belts"...</i>

371
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,160
and you should have seen
the look she gave me!

372
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,200
I thought the flesh
was gonna melt off her face.

373
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,760
<i>- [Chuckles]
- It's not funny.</i>

374
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,920
She's not happy unless everyone around her
is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.

375
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,840
And the Clackers just worship her.

376
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,760
<i>- The who?
- They call them Clackers.</i>

377
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,000
The sound that their stilettos make
in the marble lobby.

378
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,000
It's like,
"Clack, clack, clack. Clack, clack."

379
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,680
<i>[Groans] And they all act like
they're curing cancer or something.</i>

380
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,200
[Chuckling]
The amount of time and energy...

381
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,520
<i>that these people spend on these insignificant,
minute details, and for what?</i>

382
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,040
So that tomorrow they can spend
another $300,000 reshooting something...

383
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,080
<i>that was probably fine to begin with...</i>

384
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,840
to sell people things they don't need!

385
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,880
God!

386
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,080
<i>- I'm not even hungry anymore.
- What?</i>

387
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,000
<i>- That is why those girls are so skinny.
- Oh. No, no, no.</i>

388
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,480
Give me that. There's, like,
eight dollars ofJarlsberg in there.

389
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,480
[Sighs]
You know what?

390
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,520
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.

391
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,120
And then I can do
what I came to New York to do.

392
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.

393
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,360
Easy there, tiger.

394
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,520
- Oh, good morning, Miranda.
- Get me Isaac.

395
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,320
<i>I don't see my breakfast here.
Are my eggs here? Where are my eggs?</i>

396
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
Excuse me!

397
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,000
<i>Pick up the Polaroids

398
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,520

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,960
Where's that piece of paper
I had in my hand yesterday morning?

401
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,800
<i>The girls need new surfboards or
boogie boards or something for spring break.</i>

402
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,000
- Hello.
- The twins also need flip-flops.

403
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,880
- Ow!
- Oh, my gosh!

404
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,840
<i>Pick up my shoes from Blahnik,
and then go get Patricia.</i>

405
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,680
- Who's that?
- Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

406
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,360
Get me that little table
that I liked at that store on Madison.

407
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,440
<i>Get us a reservation for dinner tonight
at that place that got the good review.</i>

00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,120
<i>- Get me Isaac.
- Thirty-six thank-you notes delivered today.</i>

409
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,120
<i>- Where is everyone?
- Why is no one working?</i>

<i>[Miranda's Voice Overlapping]</i>

411
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,160
Get me Demarchelier.

412
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,640
I have Miranda Priestly calling for-
Okay.

413
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,440
I have Patrick.

414
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,680

Thank God it's Friday, right?

415
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,200
<i>At least Miranda will be in Miami,
so we don't have to be on call this weekend.</i>

416
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,160
You know,
my dad's coming in from Ohio.

417
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,800
<i>Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner,
maybe see Chicago.</i>

418
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
You doing anything fun this weekend?

419
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,200
Yes.

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,760
He actually- He applied here, but they
wanted someone with more experience.

423
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,680
- Here.
- Huh? What's this?

424
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,440
I don't want you

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,280
- Dad, how did you-
- It's-

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm gonna kill Mom.

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,840
Mm-hmm.

429
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,960
- It's really good to see you.
- You too, honey.

430
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,880
So, you want to
start grilling me now...

431
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,080
or should we wait till after dinner?

432
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,280
I thought I'd let you at least enjoy
the bread basket first.

433
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,120
No, no, no. It's okay.
Go right ahead.

434
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,560
We're just a little worried, honey.

435
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,160
We get e-mails from you
at your office at 2:00 a.m.

436
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,880
Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.

437
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,880
Hey, that's not fair.

438
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,240
I wrote those e-mails.

439
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,520
I'm just trying to understand why someone
who got accepted to Stanford Law...

440
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,240
turns it down to be a journalist,
and now you're not even doing that.

441
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Dad, you have to trust me.

442
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,120
Being Miranda's assistant
opens a lot of doors.

443
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,640
Emily is going to Paris
with Miranda in a few months...

444
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,360
and she's gonna meet editors and writers
from every important magazine.

445
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,360
And in a year, that could be me.

446
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

447
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,520

452
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,360
It's some absurd weather problem.

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,200
I need to get home tonight. The twins have
a recital tomorrow morning at school.

454
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,120

- At school!

455
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,360
- Absolutely. Let me see what I can do.
- Good.

Hi. Um, I know this

457
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,160

could maybe get a flight for my boss...

458
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,160

459
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,080
Uh-

Yes, I know there's a hurricane.

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,720
Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing is flying out?

468
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,120
It's for Miranda Priestly,
and I know that she's a client of yours.

469
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,280
Yes. Yes, hi. I need a jet tonight
from Miami to New York.

00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,080
Yeah. Sorry. Hold on.
Hello? Miranda, hi.

471
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one
is flying out because of the weather.

472
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,560
Please. It's just-
I don't know- drizzling.

Oh, my God!
She's going to murder me.

479
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,360
What does she want you to do, call the National
Guard and have her airlifted out of there?

480
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,400
Of course not. Could I do that?

481
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,680
Come on.

482
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,600
Come on.

Do you know why I hired you?

489
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,760
I always hire the same girl-

490

stylish, slender, of course...

- Ah.

651
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,160
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by hand,
finished with a metallic fringe.

652
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,120
[Clicks Tongue] Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?

653
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,160
You.

654
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,080
Hmm. Duh. This way.

655
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,800
Uh, here we go.

656
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,120
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress
for the benefit.

657
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,080
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection.
Top secret stuff.

658
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,200
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.

659
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,520
Come on.
You're working for Miranda Priestly now.

660
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,120
You must be in desperate need
of hard liquor.

661
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,360
Excuse us, girls.

662
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,440
She'll have the punch.

663
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,360
[Clears Throat]

664
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,800
It's deadly. Have fun.

666
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,400
- He's right, you know.
- Hmm?

667
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,280
The punch.
I drank it atJames's last party.

668
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,920
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing
but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

669
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,240
<i>- ##[Continues]
- Ah. Well.</i>

670
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,520
- Wise.
- [Chuckling]

671
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,440
- Uh, hi.
- Christian Thompson.

672
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,000
Christian Thompson?
You're kidding.

673
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,560
No, you're-You write for,
like, every magazine I love.

674
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,960
I actually- I reviewed your collection
of essays for my college newspaper.

675
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,840
Did you mention my good looks
and my killer charm?

676
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,080
- No, but-
- What do you do?

677
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,560
<i>Oh. Well, I want to work for somewhere
like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.</i>

678
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,560
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?

679
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,640
- Mm-hmm.
- I should read your stuff.
Why don't you send it over?

680
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,960
Yeah?

681
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,560
That would be-Thank you.
That would be great. [Giggling]

682
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,920
But actually, right now, I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

683
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,320
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad.

684
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,200
That's-Whoa.
You'll never survive Miranda.

685
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,000
- Excuse me?
- Well, you seem nice, smart.

686
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,160
You can't do that job.

687
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,840
Gotta go.

688
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,800
Okay.

689
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,360
Well, it was very, very nice
to meet you, Miranda girl.

690
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,560
Emily?

691
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,480
<i>Call James Holt's office. Tell them I want
to move the preview up to today at 12:30.</i>

692
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,240
Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.

693
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,880
<i>But we're not expected until Tuesday.
Did she say why?</i>

694
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,640
Yes. Yeah, she explained every detail
of her decision making.

695
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,600
<i>And then we brushed each other's hair
and gabbed about American Idol.</i>

696
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,520
I see your point.

697
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,880
<i>- [Andy] What's a preview anyway?
- Good morning, Miranda.</i>

698
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,800
<i>[Nigel] Miranda insists upon seeing
all the designers'collections...</i>

699
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,720
<i>before they show them.</i>

700
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,680
- Great to see you.
- Hello, James.

701
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,600
<i>- [Andy] And she tells them what she thinks?
- [Nigel] In her way.</i>

702
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,040
Uh, this season really began for me
with a meditation...

703
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,680
<i>on the intersection
between East and West.</i>

704
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,120
<i>[Nigel] There's a scale.
One nod is good. Two nods is very good.</i>

705
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,200
<i>There's only been one actual smile on record,
and that was Tom Ford in 2001.</i>

706
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,200
An obi belt.

707
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,320
<i>[Nigel]
She doesn't like it, she shakes her head.</i>

708
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,000
This is the dress that we have designed
specifically and exclusively for you.

709
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,880
<i>[Nigel] Then, of course,
there's the pursing of the lips.</i>

710
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,760
<i>[Andy]
Which means?</i>

711
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,560
<i>[Nigel]
Catastrophe.</i>

712
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,760
[Whispers]
Just, uh-Just go.

713
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,400
- I just don't understand. I'm appalled.
- It's absurd. Appalled.

714
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,680
- You deal with it.
- I'll talk to him.

715
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,760
So because she pursed her lips,
he's gonna change his entire collection?

716
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,760
You still don't get it, do you?

717
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,680
Her opinion is the only one
that matters.

718
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,560
- Call my husband and confirm dinner.
- At Pastis? Done.

719
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,560
And I'll need a change of clothes.

720
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,440
Well, I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.

721
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,000
Fine. And, Andrea, I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

722
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,480
- Have Emily give you the key.
- Mm-hmm.

723
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,960
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.

724
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,720
You know, if I can deliver the Book,
that means I must have done something right.

725
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,640
I'm not a psycho.

726
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,120
Oh, and, you know,
she called me Andrea?

727
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,760
I mean, she didn't call me Emily,
which is- Isn't that great?

728
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,320
Yeah, whoopee. Right.

729
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,080
Now, it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

730
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,040
Oh. Okay.

731
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,240
<i>[Emily]
The Book is assembled by 10:00, 10:30...</i>

732
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,600
<i>and you must wait around for it
until then.</i>

733
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,080
You will be delivering Miranda's
dry cleaning with the Book.

734
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,880
<i>Now, the car will take you straight
to Miranda's townhouse.</i>

735
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,280
<i>You let yourself in.</i>

736
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,800
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.

737
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,880
Do not look at anyone.

738
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,520
This is of the utmost importance.
You must be invisible.

739
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,760
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.

740
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,160
<i>You open the door
and you walk across the foyer.</i>

741
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,720
<i>You hang the dry cleaning
in the closet across from the staircase.</i>

742
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,800
<i>- Uh-
- And you leave the Book
on the table with the flowers.</i>

00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,240
<i>[Panting]</i>

744
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,040
<i>- Shit!
- [Girl] It's that door to the left.</i>

745
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,000
Okay.

746
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,080
[Whispers]
Thank you.

747
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,000
- You can give the Book to us.
- Shh. Which-Which table?

748
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,560
<i>- It's okay. Come on up.
- No, I can't. I can't.</i>

749
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,640
- What? It's okay.
- Come on.

750
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,120
<i>- Yeah, come on. It's okay.
- Please stop talking.</i>

751
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,680
Or you can bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.

752
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,520
She does? Right.
She does, all the time.

753
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,560
Yeah? Okay.

walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?</i>

00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,440
<i>[Man] I rushed out of
an investment committee meeting...</i>

757
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,120
and I sat there waiting for you
for almost an hour.

758
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,600
<i>I told you the cell phones didn't work.
Nobody could get a signal out.</i>

in that restaurant was thinking-</i>

00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,080
- Okay, okay! Okay, okay.
- Oh, no. Shh!

762
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,320
It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.

763
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,760
The twins said hello,
so I said hello back.

764
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,680
- Then I went up the stairs
to give her the Book and-
- You went upstairs?

765
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,400
Oh, my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed
with her and ask for a bedtime story?

766
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,400
Okay, I made a mistake. I know.

767
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,080
Andrea, you don't understand.

768
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,040
If you get fired,
that might jeopardize Paris for me.

769
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,040
If that happens, I will search every Blimpie's
in the tristate area until I track you down.

770
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,000
She's gonna fire me?

771
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,920
I don't know. She's not happy.

00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,400
I need the new Harry Potter book
for the twins.

776
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,840
Okay. Okay. I'll go down
to Barnes & Noble right now.

Not that I can recall.

779
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,880
We have all the published Harry Potter books.
The twins want to know what happens next.

780
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,280
You want the unpublished manuscript?

00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,040
<i>We know everyone in publishing.
It shouldn't be a problem, should it?</i>

00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,400
Yes, Bobbsey. I know, baby.

Mommy's working very hard
to get it for you.

She doesn't get it.

I could call frickin'J.K. Rowling herself.
I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.

<i>My girls are leaving on the train

so the book better be here
no later than 3:00.

00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,840
- Of course!
- And I would like my steak here in 15 minutes.

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,400
No problem!

792
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,680
<i>Okay. I have four hours
to get the impossible manuscript.</i>

793

How am I gonna get the steak?

- No. Shan't.

Yes, yes, yes, yes. I've been on hold.
It's for Miranda Priestly.

797
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,560
It's very important.

798
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,840
Yes, I know it's impossible to get...

799
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,360
but, well, I was wondering if you
could make the impossible possible...

Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.

01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:04,400
For shoes and shirts
and jackets and belts.

1463
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,520
Nate.

1464
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,600
I'm sorry.

1465
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,520
L-
[Clears Throat]

1466
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,680
I flew up to Boston while you were gone.

1467
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,280
I interviewed at the Oak Room.

1468
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,720
And?

1469
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:32,600
And you're looking
at their new sous-chef.

1470
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:36,400
- I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
- That's great. Congratulations.

1471
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,920
I don't know what I'm gonna do without
those late-night grilled cheeses, but-

1472
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:48,920
I'm pretty sure
they have bread in Boston.

1473
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,160
<i>May even haveJarlsberg.</i>

1474
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:56,440
We might be able
to figure something out.

1475
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,360
You think?

1476
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,280
Yeah.

1477
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:12,280
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?

1478
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,600
Actually, I, uh-
I have a job interview today.

1479
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:18,000
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1480
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,280
That's what you're wearing?

1481
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,200
Shut up. I like this.

1482
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,000
- Andy, Greg Hill.
- Hello.

1483
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,400
Come on. These clips are excellent.

1484
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:34,280
This thing on the janitors' union,
that's exactly what we do here.

1485
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,120
<i>My only question is, Runway?</i>

1486
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:37,200
<i>My only question is, Runway?</i>

1487
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,840
You were there for less than a year.

1488
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:41,840
What the hell kind of a blip is that?

1489
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,000
Learned a lot.

1490
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,560
In the end though,
I kind of screwed it up.

1491
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:55,040
I called over there for a reference,
left word with some snooty girl.

1492
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:58,560
<i>Next thing you know, I got a fax
from Miranda Priestly herself...</i>

1493
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:01,080
saying that of all the assistants
she's ever had...

1494
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,320
you were, by far,
her biggest disappointment.

1495
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:08,400
<i>And, if I don't hire you,
I am an idiot.</i>

1496
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:13,320
You must have done something right.

1497
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,920
<i>- [Beeping]
- [Phone Ringing]</i>

1498
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,840
Miranda Priestly's office.

1499
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:50,920
Hey, Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up.
I have a favor to ask you.

1500
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,680
You have a favor to ask of me?

1501
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,880
Yeah. The thing is,
I have all these clothes from Paris...

1502
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,920
and I don't have anyplace
to wear them...

1503
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,000
so I was wondering if you
could take them off my hands.

1504
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:10,960
Well, I don't know.
It's a huge imposition.

1505
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:15,120
And I'll have to get them taken in.
I mean, they'll drown me.

1506
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:19,480
But I suppose I could help you out.
I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.

1507
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:24,000
Thanks, Em. I appreciate it.
Good luck.

1508
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,440
You have some very large shoes to fill.

1509
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,880
I hope you know that.

1510
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:48,360
I don't understand
why it is so challenging...

1511
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:51,920
to get my car when I ask for it.

1512
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,080
[Chuckles]

1513
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:37,360
Go.
