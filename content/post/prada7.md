1011
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,080
- Look at you.
- Hello.

1012
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
You're-You're a vision.

1013
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,880
- Oh. [Scoffs]
- Thank God I saved your job.

1014
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,640
[Stammers, Chuckles] You know,
I figured out a few things on my own too.

1015
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,000
Turns out,
I'm not as nice as you thought.

1016
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,480
I hope not.

1017
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,600
Well, if it weren't
for the stupid boyfriend...

1018
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,560
I'd have to whisk you away
right here and now.

1019
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,640
- Do you actually say things like that to people?
- Evidently.

1020
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,320
[Giggles]
Well, I gotta go.

1021
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,200
Are you sure? 'Cause my editor
for New York Magazine is inside...

1022
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,240
and, you know,
I could introduce you two.

1023
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,760
- You sent over your stuff
for me to look at? Remember?
- Yeah.

1024
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,400
All right, I gotta admit, I only read a couple.
It was a very large packet you sent.

1025
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,320
- Yeah.
- But what I did read wasn't half bad.

1026
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,760
And, you know, I think-
I think you have a talent, Andy.

1027
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,560
He should meet you.

1028
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,640
Why don't you come in?
Just for one drink.

1029
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,680
Um, okay, yeah.
I guess I could for one-

1030
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,840
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1031
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,360
All right.
Give my best to the boyfriend.

1032
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,440
Roy, I'm sorry.
Can you go any faster?

1033
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,200
I'm sure Nate will understand.

1034
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,120
Yeah.

1035
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,920
[TV, Indistinct]

1036
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,760
Hey.

1037
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,440
Happy birthday.

1038
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,080
Nate, I'm so sorry.

1039
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,080
I kept trying to leave,
but there was a lot going on.

1040
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,200
And, you know, I didn't have a choice.

1041
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,120
Don't worry about it.

1042
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,120
[Grunts]
I'm gonna go to bed.

1043
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,320
Can we at least talk about this?

1044
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,160
You look really pretty.

1045
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,920
[Miranda]
Andrea?

1046
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,640
- Do you have the Book?
- Oh. Uh-

1047
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,760
Mm.

1048
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,040
Paris is the most important week
of my entire year.

1049
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,240
I need the best possible team with me.

1050
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,640
That no longer includes Emily.

1051
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,840
Wait. You want me to-

1052
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,080
No, Miranda.

1053
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,280
[Exhales]
Emily would die.

1054
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,680
Her whole life is about Paris.

1055
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,000
She hasn't eaten in weeks.
L-I can't... do that.

1056
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,760
Miranda, I can't.

1057
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,800
If you don't go, I'll assume you're
not serious about your future...

1058
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,480
at Runway or any other publication.

1059
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,040
The decision's yours.

1060
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,120
That's all.

- Hey, Andy.

1065

- Hey.
- You coming to bed anytime soon?

1066
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,760
Uh, yeah. Five minutes, okay?

1070
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,560
Andrea, don't forget to tell Emily.

1071
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,000
Do it now.

1072
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,600
- [Line Ringing]
- Don't pick up.

1073
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,160
- Don't pick up. Don't pick up. Don't pick-
- Hi.

1074
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,080
- Emily.
- Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.

1075
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,680
It's just Miranda wanted
some scarves from Hermès.

1076
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,240
And she did tell me yesterday,
but I forgot like an idiot.

1077
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,160
And so I freaked out, of course.

1078
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,880
Emily, Emily, l-I need to talk to you.

1079
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,800
I called Martine at home, and she opened
the shop early. Whoa! I'm sorry.

1080
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,680
She opened the shop early for me,
so I got them, which is great.

1081
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,080
Okay. Um, Emily,
wh-when you come in...

1082
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,400
there's something
I have to talk to you about.

1083
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,080
- Well, I hope it's not another Miranda problem.
- Not exactly.

1084
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:26,560
Well, good, because I've got so much
to deal with before I go. I swear to God-

1087
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,040

[Elevator Bell Dings]

1090
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,400
I don't care if she was gonna fire you
or beat you with a red-hot poker!

1091
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,320
You should have said no.

1092
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,320
Emily, I didn't have a choice.

1093
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,440
- Oh. Please.
- You know how she is.

1094
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,040
- That is a pathetic excuse.
- [Door Opens]

1095
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,560
Thanks.

1096
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,040
Do you know what really just...

1097
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,680
gets me about this whole thing...

1098
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,920
is that, you know, you're the one who said
you don't really care about this stuff.

1099
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,760
And you don't really care about fashion.
You just wanna be a journalist.

1100
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,680
What a pile of bollocks!

1101
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,760
Emily, I know you're mad.
I don't blame you.

1102
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:22,800
Face it, you sold your soul the day
you put on that first pair ofJimmy Choo's.

1103
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,520
I saw it. And you know what really
just kills me about this whole thing...

1104
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,560
is the clothes that you're gonna get.

1105
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,360
I mean, you don't deserve them.

1106
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,040
You eat carbs, for Christ's sake.

1107
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,280
God, it's so unfair.!

1108
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,600
- Emily.
- Just go.

1109
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,720
- Emily, l-
- I said go!

[Sighs]

1111
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,920
- [Doug] You are going to Paris
for the couture shows?
- [Andy] Mm-hmm.

1112
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,600
- That's the coolest fashion event of the year.
- Mm-hmm.

1113
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,800
- I mean, who are you going to see, Galliano?
- Yeah.

1114
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,600
- And Lagerfeld and Nicholas Ghesquiere.
- Yep.

1115
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,360
- Yes. Okay, now you're scaring me.
- [Chuckles]

1116

- Hey.

1117

- This show is amazing. I am so proud of you.
- [Lily] Thank you.

1118
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,120
Okay, start with the photos in the back
and work your way forward.

1119
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,200
That is the way I designed it.
It is brilliant.

1120
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,600
- You will love it.
- Of course.

1121
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,080
And you, I have somebody
I want you to meet, okay?

1122
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,040
Ooh, art and sex. Lead the way.

1123
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,040

- Hey. Hey, Miranda girl.

1126
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,080
- Hi.
- I was just thinking about you.

1127
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,040
Oh, come on.

1128
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,960
- It's true.
- No.

1129
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,440
I'm profiling Gaultier for Interview
and, uh, making my Paris plans.

1130
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,800
I found myself wondering
if, uh, you were gonna be there.

1131
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:12,840
Well, actually, um, I am going.

1132
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,360
Great. I'm staying in a fantastic
little hotel in the Seventh...

1133
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,280
right across the street from the falafel
restaurant that will change your life.

1134
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:26,160
[Chuckles]
I'm sorry. I'll be too busy working.

1135
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,800
You'll have to find
someone else's life to change.

1136
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,360
Well, that's just it.

1137
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,560
I'm beginning to wonder if I can.

1138
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,600
Lily.

1139
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,040
Lily, he's just a guy I know from work.

1140
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,880
- Yeah, that looked like work.
- Look, you're making a big deal out of-

1141
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,240
You know, the Andy I know
is madly in love with Nate...

1142
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,440
is always five minutes early...

1143
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,160
and thinks, I don't know,
Club Monaco is couture.

1144
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,720
For the last 16 years, I've known
everything about that Andy.

1145
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,600
But this person? This "glamazon"
who skulks around in corners...

1146
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,640
with some random hot fashion guy?

1147
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,680
I don't get her.

1148
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,080
- Lily.
- Have fun in Paris.

1149
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,520
You going to Paris?

1150
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,120
Uh, yeah. It just happened.

1151
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,520
I thought Paris
was a big deal for Emily or-

1152
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,360
Great. Now you're gonna
give me a hard time too?

1153
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:36,520
Hey, Andy. Andy!

1154
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,760
- Andy, what the hell is wrong with you?
- L-I didn't have a choice, okay?

1155
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,920
- Miranda asked me, and I couldn't say no.
- I know.

1156
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,960
That's your answer for everything lately,
"I didn't have a choice."

1157
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,880
- Like this job was forced on you.
- Nate, I get it, okay?

1158
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,840
Like you don't make
these decisions yourself.

1159
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,200
You're mad because I work late all the time
and I missed your birthday party.

1160
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,600
- And I'm sorry.
- Oh, come on. What am I, four?

1161
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,440
You-You hate Runway
and Miranda.

1162
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,280
And you think fashion is stupid.
You've made that clear.

1163
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,600
Andy, I make
port wine reductions all day.

1164
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,720
I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps.

1165
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,640
You know, I wouldn't care if you were
out there pole dancing all night...

1166
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:09,160
as long as you did it
with a little integrity.

1167
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,920
You used to say this was just a job.

1168
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,240
You used to make fun
of the Runway girls.

1335

[Door Opens]

1336
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,040
Bonjour, madame.

1337
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,480
Uh, what the hell is this?

1338
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,680
What does it look like?
It's a mock-up.

1339
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,800
Yeah. Of?

1340
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,840
Of what American Runway will look like
when Jacqueline Follet is the new editor in chief.

1341
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,920
Wh-They're replacing Miranda?

1342
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,640
Yeah. And she's bringing me in
to run all the editorial content.

1343
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,000
You're really surprised?

1344
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,720
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.
She has a fresher take on things.

1345
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:21,040
Not to mention American Runway's one
of the most expensive books in the business.

1346
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:25,080
Jacqueline does the same thing
for a lot less money.

1347
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:28,520
And Irv-
Irv's a businessman, you know.

1348
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:32,760
Miranda will be devastated. Her whole life
is about Runway. He can't do that to her.

1349
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,200
It's done. Irv's gonna tell Miranda
after the party forJames.

1350
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,240
And she has no idea?

1351
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,720
She's a big girl. She'll be fine.

1352
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,880
Shi- I have to go.

01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,520
Oh! Oh! Thank God you're there.

1359
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,160
- [Sighs] Excuse me?
- I need to talk to you right away.

1360
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,480
It's aboutJacqueline Follet.

1361
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,960
Shit! Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit!

1362
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,360
- Yes.
- Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was wondering-

1363
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,960
Have you completely lost your mind?

1364
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:43,040
- I need to talk to you.
- Do not disturb me again.

1365
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,040
But, um, it's just for one- Miranda!

[Horn Honks]

1367
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:07,080
Miranda. Miranda.
Wait, I need to talk to you.

1368
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,640
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet
the editor in chief of Runway.

1369
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,640
Christian Thompson told me
he's gonna work for her.

1370
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,040
Irv is going to tell you today. I thought
maybe if I told you, that you could fix it.

1371
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,960
Do I smell freesias?

1372
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:21,080
What? No.
L-I specifically told them-

1373
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,440
If I see freesias anywhere...

1374
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,640
I will be very disappointed.

1375
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:33,000
For 72 years, Runway
has been more than a magazine.

1376
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,600
It has been a beacon
of elegance and grace.

1377
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:41,840
Miranda Priestly is the finest
possible guardian of that beacon...

1378
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:47,040
setting a standard that inspires
people across the globe.

1379
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:50,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Miranda Priestly.

1380
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,400
Thank you, my dear friend.

1381
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,280
Bonjour.
[Chuckles]

1382
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,320
Thank you very much
for coming today...

1383
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:21,680
to help celebrate
our dear friend, James Holt.

1384
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,840
But before I talk to you aboutJames...

1385
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:36,280
and his many accomplishments...

1386
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:40,040
I would like first to share
some news with you.

1387
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,840
Um, as many of you know...

1388
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,560
uh, recently Massimo Corteleoni...

1389
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:51,560
has agreed to finance the expansion
of theJames Holt label...

1390
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:55,480
transforming the work
of this visionary artist...

1391
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,880
into a global brand,
which is really an exciting enterprise.

1392
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:03,880
Runway and James Holt share
many things in common...

1393
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:07,960
chief among them,
a commitment to excellence.

1394
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,640
And so, it should come as no surprise
that when the time came...

1395
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:17,120
forJames to choose the new president
ofJames Holt International...

1396
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:20,040
he chose from within
the Runway family.

1397
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,040
And it's my great happiness today...

1398
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,680
to announce to you all
that that person...

1399
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:32,920
is my friend
and longtime esteemed colleague...

1400
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,840
Jacqueline Follet.

1401
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,040
Thank you. Merci.

1402
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:07,680
And now to the main event...

1403
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,880
our celebration ofJames Holt.

1404
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,640
We at Runway
are very proud to have been-

1405
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,520
When the time is right,
she'll pay me back.

1406
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,800
You sure about that?

1407
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,120
No.

1408
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:28,120
But I hope for the best.

1409
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,520
I have to.

01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,120
You thought I didn't know.

1412
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,360
I've known what was happening
for quite some time.

1413
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:01,800
Itjust took me a little while to find
a suitable alternative forJacqueline.

1414
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,080
And thatJames Holtjob
was so absurdly overpaid...

1415
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,800
that, of course, she jumped at it.

1416
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:13,880
So I just had to tell Irv
thatJacqueline was unavailable.

1417
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,400
The truth is, there is no one
that can do what I do...

1418
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:21,040
including her.

1419
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,480
Any of the other choices would
have found that job impossible...

1420
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,480
and the magazine would have suffered.

1421
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:30,280
[Sighs]
Especially because of the list.

1422
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,000
The list of designers, photographers...

1423
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,920
editors, writers, models, all of whom
were found by me, nurtured by me...

1424
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,720
and have promised me
they will follow me...

1425
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,840
whenever and if ever
I choose to leave Runway.

[Chuckles]

1427
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,840
So he reconsidered.

1428
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:55,520
But I was very, very impressed...

1429
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:58,520
by how intently you tried to warn me.

1430
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:01,640
I never thought I would say this,
Andrea...

1431
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:05,120
but I really-

1432
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,400
I see a great deal of myself in you.

1433
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:14,640
You can see beyond what people want
and what they need...

1434
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:17,120
and you can choose for yourself.

1435
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:24,040
I don't think I'm like that.

I couldn't do what you did to Nigel,
Miranda.

1438
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,680
I couldn't do something like that.

1439
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,000
Mm. You already did.

That's not what l-

1442
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,600
No, that was- that was different.
I didn't have a choice.

1443
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:52,520
Oh, no, you chose.
You chose to get ahead.

1444
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:56,600
You want this life,
those choices are necessary.

1445

But what if this isn't what I want?

1446
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:05,400
I mean, what if I don't wanna
live the way you live?

1447
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,440
Don't be ridiculous, Andrea.

and I don't have anyplace
to wear them...

1503
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,000
so I was wondering if you
could take them off my hands.

1504
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:10,960
Well, I don't know.
It's a huge imposition.

1505
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:15,120
And I'll have to get them taken in.
I mean, they'll drown me.

1506
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:19,480
But I suppose I could help you out.
I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.

1507
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:24,000
Thanks, Em. I appreciate it.
Good luck.

1508
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,440
You have some very large shoes to fill.

1509
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,880
I hope you know that.

1510
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:48,360
I don't understand
why it is so challenging...

1511
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:51,920
to get my car when I ask for it.

1512
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,080
[Chuckles]

1513
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:37,360
Go.
