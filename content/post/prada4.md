### Chapter 4


484
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,160
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.

485
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,320
Everyone except me...

486
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,400
because, sadly, I was not there.

487
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,720
Miranda, I'm so sorry.

488
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,720
Do you know why I hired you?

489
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,760
I always hire the same girl-

490
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,160
stylish, slender, of course...

491
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,080
worships the magazine.

492
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,120
But so often, they turn out to be-

493
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,480
I don't know- disappointing and, um...

494
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,400
stupid.

495
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,280
So you, with that impressive résumé...

496
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,360
and the big speech
about your so-called work ethic-

497
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,280
I, um- I thought you
would be different.

498
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
I said to myself, go ahead.

499
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,400
Take a chance.

500
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,680
Hire the smart, fat girl.

501
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,560
[Clears Throat]
I had hope.

502
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,640
My God. I live on it.

503
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,800
Anyway, you ended up
disappointing me more than, um-

504
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,640
more than any of the other silly girls.

505
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,920
Um, I really did everything
I could think of.

506
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,280
- Uh-
- That's all.

507
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,760
Excuse me!
Where do you think you're going?

508
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,240
She hates me, Nigel.

509
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
And that's my problem because-

510
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,360
Oh, wait. No, it's not my problem.

511
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,600
I don't know what else I can do because
if I do something right, it's unacknowledged.

512
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,600
She doesn't even say thank you.

513
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,800
But if I do something wrong,
she is vicious.

514
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,360
- So quit.
- What?

515
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,360
- Quit.
- Quit?

516
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,800
I can get another girl to take your job
in five minutes- one who really wants it.

517
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,320
No, I don't want to quit.
That's not fair.

518
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,560
But, you know, I'm just saying
that I would just like a little credit...

519
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,000
for the fact
that I'm killing myself trying.

520
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,480
Andy, be serious.

521
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,880
You are not trying.

522
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,640
- You are whining.
- L-

523
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,320
What is it that you want me
to say to you, huh?

524
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,160
Do you want me to say, "Poor you.
Miranda's picking on you. Poor you. Poor Andy"?

525
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,520
Hmm? Wake up, six.

526
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,000
She's just doing herjob.

527
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,360
Don't you know that you
are working at the place...

528
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,760
that published some
of the greatest artists of the century?

529
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,200
Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.

530
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,480
And what they did, what they created...

531
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,200
was greater than art
because you live your life in it.

532
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,600
Well, not you, obviously,
but some people.

533
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,240
You think
this is just a magazine, hmm?

534
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,240
This is not just a magazine.

535
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,600
This is a shining beacon of hope for-

536
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,560
oh, I don't know-

537
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,520
let's say a young boy growing up
in Rhode Island with six brothers...

538
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,600
pretending to go to soccer practice
when he was really going to sewing class...

539
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,920
and reading Runway under the covers
at night with a flashlight.

540
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,360
You have no idea how many legends
have walked these halls.

541
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,560
And what's worse, you don't care.

542
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,440
Because this place, where so many
people would die to work...

543
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,480
you only deign to work.

544
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,920
And you want to know why
she doesn't kiss you on the forehead...

545
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,280
and give you a gold star on your homework
at the end of the day.

546
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,200
Wake up, sweetheart.

547
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,240
[Sighs]

548
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,760
- Okay. So I'm screwing it up.
- Mmm.

549
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,040
I don't want to.

550
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,720
I just wish that I knew
what I could do to-

551
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,080
- [Sighs] Nigel?
- Hmm?

552
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
Nigel, Nigel.

553
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,400
No.

554
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,520
I don't know what you expect me to do.

555
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,080
There's nothing in this whole closet
that'll fit a size six.

556
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,600
I can guarantee you.

557
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,040
These are all sample sizes-
two and four.

558
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,160
- All right. We're doing this for you. And-
- A poncho?

559
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,720
You'll take what I give you
and you'll like it.

560
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,720
- We're doing this Dolce for you.
- Hmm!

561
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,160
And shoes.

562
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,560
- Jimmy Choo's.
- Hmm.

563
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,560
- Manolo Blahnik.
- Wow.

564
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,120
Nancy Gonzalez. Love that.

565
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,520
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love.

566
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,200
- Uh, it might fit. It might.
- What?

567
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,760
Okay. Now, Chanel. You're in desperate
need of Chanel. Darling, shall we?

568
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,880
We have to get to the beauty department,
and God knows how long that's going to take.

569
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
[Groans]

570
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,480
I mean, I have no idea
why Miranda hired her.

571
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,280
Me neither. The other day,
we were in the beauty department.

572
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,760
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler
and said, "What is this?"

573
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,000
[Laughing]

574
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,560
I just knew
from the moment I saw her...

575
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,400
she was going to be
a complete and utter disas-

576
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,280
- [Phone Rings]
- Miranda Priestly's office.

577
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,640
No, actually, she's not available,
but I'll leave word.

578
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,360
Okay, thanks. Bye.
[Clears Throat]

579
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,360
How did-
[Grunts]

580
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,800
- Are you wearing the-
- The Chanel boots?

581
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,360
Yeah, I am.

582
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,360
You look good.

583
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,080
- Oh, God.
- What?

584
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,520
- She does.
- Oh, shut up, Serena.

585
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,640
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Good night, man. Take it easy.

586
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,760
Take care of that finger, huh?

587
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,200
So, what do you think?

588
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,960
Uh, I think we better get out of here...

589
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,400
before my girlfriend sees me.

597
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,640
So we spent a whole semester
on potatoes alone.

598
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,520
You take the fry and squeeze it.

599
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,440
- See how firm that is?
- Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

600
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,880
There was a crisis
in the accessories department.

601
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,840
- I needed to find a python headband.
- Python's hot right now.

602
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,480
I have exciting presents for all of you.

603
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,200
Are you ready?

604
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,680
- What is that?
- It's a Bang & Olufsen phone.

605
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,440
Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda
for her birthday.

606
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,520
I looked it up on line.
It's $1,100.

607
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,240
- What?
- Wow!

608
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,480
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.

609
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,880
- A little Clinique.
- Ooh!

610
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,320
- Oh, damn it. I love your job.
- Oh.! One more.

611
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,360
- A little thing.
- [Gasps]

- Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,120
- I think she likes it.
- Oh, my God! This is the new MarcJacobs!

614
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,600
This is sold out everywhere.
Where did you get this?

615
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,960
Miranda didn't want it, so-

616
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,920
No, no, no, no, no. This bag is, like, $1,900.
I cannot take this from you.

617
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,360
- [Cackles]
- Yeah, you can.

618
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,120
- Why do women need so many bags?
- Shut up.

619
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,280
You have one. You put all your junk in it,
and that's it. You're done.

620
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,280
Fashion is not about utility.

621
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,960
An accessory is merely
a piece of iconography...

622
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,840
used to express individual identity.

623
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,200
- Oh! And it's pretty.
- That too.

624
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,840
Yeah. But the thing is, it turns out there is
more to Runway than just fancy purses.

625
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,720
Look, here's an essay byJay Mclnerney,
a piece byJoan Didion.

626
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,880
Even an interview
with Christiane Amanpour.

- I got it. It's-Yup, the Dragon Lady.

- Oh, Miranda?
- Let me talk to her.

630
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,440
- I need that.
- I'll tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.

631
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,160
Lily, no, no, no! Put that thing up!
I was gonna answer it!

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,080
I'm Andy.
I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.

648
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,680
Oh, yes.
You must be the new Emily.

649
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,360
- [Chuckling]
- Nice to meet you.

650
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,760
- Oh, let me see that bag. Very, very nice.
- Ah.

651
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,160
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by hand,
finished with a metallic fringe.

652
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,120
[Clicks Tongue] Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?

653
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,160
You.

654
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,080
Hmm. Duh. This way.

655
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,800
Uh, here we go.

656
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,120
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress
for the benefit.

657
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,080
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection.
Top secret stuff.

658
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,200
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.

659
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,520
Come on.
You're working for Miranda Priestly now.

660
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,120
You must be in desperate need
of hard liquor.

661
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,360
Excuse us, girls.

662
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,440
She'll have the punch.

663
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,360
[Clears Throat]

664
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,800
It's deadly. Have fun.

665
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,800
##[Man Singing]

666
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,400
- He's right, you know.
- Hmm?

667
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,280
The punch.
I drank it atJames's last party.

668
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,920
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing
but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

669
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,240
- ##[Continues]
- Ah. Well.

670
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,520
- Wise.
- [Chuckling]

671
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,440
- Uh, hi.
- Christian Thompson.

672
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,000
Christian Thompson?
You're kidding.

673
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,560
No, you're-You write for,
like, every magazine I love.

674
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,960
I actually- I reviewed your collection
of essays for my college newspaper.

675
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,840
Did you mention my good looks
and my killer charm?

676
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,080
- No, but-
- What do you do?

677
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,560
Oh. Well, I want to work for somewhere
like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.

678
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,560
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?

679
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,640
- Mm-hmm.
- I should read your stuff.
Why don't you send it over?

680
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,960
Yeah?

681
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,560
That would be-Thank you.
That would be great. [Giggling]

682
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,920
But actually, right now, I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

683
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,320
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad.

684
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,200
That's-Whoa.
You'll never survive Miranda.

685
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,000
Excuse me?
Well, you seem nice, smart.

686
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,160
You can't do that job.

687
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,840
Gotta go.

688
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,800
Okay.

689
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,360
Well, it was very, very nice
to meet you, Miranda girl.
