Hello?


Andrea, Miranda decided to kill
the autumn jacket story for September...


and she is pulling up
the Sedona shoot from October.


You need to come into the office right this
second and pick up her coffee order on the way.


 Now?
 Now, get a pen and write this down.


 Now?
 Now, get a pen and write this down.


I want one nofoam skimmed latte
with an extra shot...


and three drip coffees
with room for milk.


 Searing hot. And I mean hot.

 [Cell Phone Ringing]


Hello?


 [Emily] Where are you?
 Oh, I'm almost there. Yeah.


Shoot! Oh!


##[Ends]


Is there some reason
that my coffee isn't here?


Has she died or something?


No. [Whispers] God.


Oh. Bloody time.


 I hope you know that this
is a very difficult job
 Mmhmm.


For which you are totally wrong.


And if you mess up,
my head is on the chopping block.


Now, hang that up.
Don't just fling it anywhere.


Okay. First of all,
you and I answer the phones.


The phone must be answered
every single time it rings.


Calls roll to voice mail,
and she gets very upset.


If I'm not hereAndrea, Andrea


you are chained to that desk.


 Well, what if I need to
 What? No.


One time an assistant left the desk because
she sliced her hand open with a letter opener...


and Miranda missed Lagerfeld...


just before he boarded
a hour flight to Australia.


She now works at TVGuide.


 Man the desk at all times. Got it.
 [Phone Rings]


 Uh
 Miranda Priestly's office.


No, she's not available.


 Who is it?
 [Mouthing Words]


Yes, I will tell her
you called... yet again.


 [Bell Chimes]
 Right. Remember, you and I
have totally differentjobs.


I mean, you get coffee
[Scoffs] and you <a name="a">run errands.</a>


Yet I am in charge of her schedule...


her appointments and her expenses.


And, um, most importantly, um...


I get to go with her to Paris
for Fashion Week in the fall.


I get to wear couture.
I go to all the shows and all the parties.


I meet all of the designers.
It's divine.


Okay. Now, stay here. I'm going to
the art department to give them the Book.


 The
 This is the Book.


Now, it is a mockup of everything...


in the current issue.


And we deliver it to Miranda's apartment
every night, and she retu


Don't touch it. She returns it to us
in the morning with her notes.


Now, the second assistant
is supposed to do this...


but Miranda is very private
and she does not like strangers in her house.


So until she decides
that you are not a total psycho...


I get the lovely task
of waiting around for the Book.


[Phone Rings]
Oh, Emily? What do I do


<a name="b">Deal with it.</a>
[Rings]


[Sighs]


[Rings]


Hello. Mrs. Priestly's office.


Hmm. That's what I meant.

Um, you know, she is in a meeting.
Can I please take a message?


Uhhuh.


Okay. Can you please spell Gabbana?


 [Line Clicks, Dial Tone Hums]
 Hello?


I guess not.


I guessed an eight and a half.


Um, uh, that's very nice of you...


but I don't think I need these.


Miranda hired me.
She knows what I look like.


 Do you?
 [Chuckles]


Emily.


Emily?


She means you.


 Wejust cut on the bias.
 [Miranda] That's not what I asked you.


I couldn't have been clearer.
There you are, Emily.


 How many times do I have to scream your name?
 Actually, it's Andy.


My name is Andy.
Andrea, but, uh, everybody calls me Andy.


[Chuckles]
I need  or  skirts from Calvin Klein.


 What kind of skirts do you

Remind Jocelyn I need to see a few of those
satchels that Marc is doing in the pony.


And then tell Simone I'll takeJackie
if Maggie isn't available.


 Did Demarchelier confirm?
 DDid DDemarchel


Demarchelier.
Did he Get him on the phone.


Uh, o okay.


 And, Emily?
 Yes?


That's all.


It's just the cavalier disregard
for clear directions


[Chattering Continues]


Do you have Demarchelier?


Uh, Demarchelier.


 [Groans] Leave it.
 Do you have


I have Miranda Priestly calling.


I have Patrick!


Uh, no, she called me in there
andand then she asked me about Pier .


And there was something
about Simone, Frankie, someone else.


And, um, she needs skirts
from Calvin Klein.


And, uh, there was something
about a pony.


 Did she say which skirts?
 No. No.


 Did she say what kind? Color, shape, fabric?
 I tried to ask her.


You may never ask Miranda anything.


Right. I will deal with all of this,
and you will go to Calvin Klein.


Eh Me?


Oh, I'm sorry. <a name="c">Do you have
some prior commitment?</a>


Some hideous skirt convention

 [Horn Honks]


 Hello? Hi.
 [Emily] While you're out...


Miranda needs you to go to Hermès
to pick up  scarves we ordered for her.


 Okay.
 Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton.
Pick that up.


Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, and
she will want more Starbucks when she gets back.


 Hot Starbucks.
 Can you just repeat that first


 [Dial Tone Hums]
 Hello?


Oh, my God.


What took you so long?
I have to pee!


What?
You haven't peed since I left?


No, I haven't. I've been manning
the desk, haven't I? I'm bursting.


Oh, hi.


 [Snaps Fingers]
 You do coat. Do the coat!


Okay.


Now, be prepared.
The runthrough is at :.


People are panicking, so the phone
is going to be ringing off the hook.


The ruThe runthrough. Right.


Yes. Editors bring in options for the shoot,
and Miranda chooses.


She chooses every single thing
in every single issue.


Runthroughs are a huge deal.
I don't know why you don't know that, Andrea.


 [Woman] Okay. Are you ready?
 [Emily] Oh, hi, hi.


Right. Well, after the loo,
Serena and I are going to lunch.

Hmm. Corn chowder.


That's an interesting choice.


You do know that <a name="d">cellulite</a> is one
of the main ingredients in corn chowder.


##[Man Singing In French Continues]


So none of the girls here eat anything?


Not since two became the new four
and zero became the new two.


 Well, I'm a six.
 Which is the new .


Oh. Shoot.


Oh, never mind. I'm sure you have plenty
more polyblend where that came from.


 [Cash Register Clicking]
 Okay. You think my clothes are hideous.


I get it.


But, you know, I'm not going
to be in fashion forever...


so I don't see the point of changing everything
about myself just because I have this job.


Yes, that's true.


That's really what this multibilliondollar
industry is all about anyway, isn't it?


 Inner beauty.
 [Cell Phone Rings]


Hello.


Right. Come on.


 Miranda's pushed the runthrough
up a half an hour.
 Mmm!


 She's always  minutes early.
