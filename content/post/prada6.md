### Chapter 6

839
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,800
- Excuse me.
- [Horn Honks]

840
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,880
- Welcome to the St. Regis.
May I assist you with anything?
- Oh. Yes.

841
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,880
- Uh, I'm meeting someone at the King Cole Bar.
- Right this way.

842
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,200
Hi.

843
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,880
- You have one hour.
- Thank you.

844
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,760
One copy. What are my twins
gonna do with that? Share?

845
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,680
Oh, no, I made two copies...

846
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,080
and had them covered, reset and bound
so that they wouldn't look like manuscripts.

847
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,800
This is an extra copy to have on file.
You know, just in case.

848
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,760
Well, where are these fabulous copies?
I don't see them anywhere.

849
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,480
[Whistle Blows]

850
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,560
[Andy] They're with the twins,
on the train on the way to Grandma's.

851
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,680
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

852
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,880
Mm-mmm. That's all.

853
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,560
Okay.

854
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,120
[Door Opens]

855
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,520
- Hey.
- Hey. I went to Dean & Deluca.

856
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,560
Man, they charge, like,
five dollars a strawberry there.

857
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,040
But I figure since you quit your job...

858
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,080
we should celebrate.

859
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,040
- Listen, Nate.
- Wait a minute.

860
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,920
You quit your job, but you're still working
on the twins' science project?

861
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,240
Well, that's big of you.

862
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,760
Okay, after we talked, I realized...

863
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,720
it doesn't make sense throwing away
all those months ofhard work.

864
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,960
I just had a moment of weakness,
that's all.

865
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,360
Yeah, well, either that,
or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.

866
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,000
All right. Whatever. It's your job.

867
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,080
Nate.

868
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,240
Come on.

869
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,320
I'm still the same person I was.

870
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,720
I still want the same things. Okay?

871
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,720
- Mm-hmm.
- I promise. Same Andy, better clothes.

872
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,840
- [Giggles]
- I like the old clothes.

873
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,760
Really?

874
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,720
Well, what about these necklaces?
Do you like them?

875
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,520
No? And this dress, it's new.

876
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,560
Eh.

877
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,160
Well, there is one other thing
that's new...

878
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,200
that I thought you might like.

879
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,640
But, uh-What about this?

880
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,320
You don't like it.
I should better do-

881
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,280
No, no, no, no.

882
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,000
##[Woman Singing]

883
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,440
##[Ends]

884
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,480
Is this number two look?
This is number two?

885
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,640
- Hi.
- Hi. All right. Turn around for me, darling.

886
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,880
Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it.

887
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,920
The piece is called "urban jungle,"right?

888
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,440
Yes, the modern woman unleashes
the animal within to take on the big city.

889
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,280
[Growls]
Good. Go.

890
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,720
[Sighs] Sometimes I can't believe
I talk about this crap all day.

891
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,200
- Bobby, come here. Let me see.
- Oh, thank you.

892
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,400
- Make sure Miranda gets these as soon as possible.
- Mm-hmm.

893
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,640
And tell her I switched in the Dior
for the Rocha.

894
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,080
- Oh, great. Can't wait.
- Excuse me.

895
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,360
- Can we adjust the attitude?
- I'm sorry.

896
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,520
- Don't make me feed you to one of the models.
- I'm sorry.

897
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,440
It's a busy day.

898
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,720
My personal life
is hanging by a thread, that's all.

899
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,960
Join the club. That's what happens
when you start doing well at work, darling.

900
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,080
Let me know when your whole life
goes up in smoke.

901
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,080
That means it's time for a promotion.

902
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,240
No. All right, February,
back of the issue.

903
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,800
Did anybody speak
with Salma's people yet?

904
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,520
Yes, but she'd rather do a summer cover
because she has a movie coming out.

905
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,640
No. Also, I'm pulling the Toobin piece
on the Supreme Court women-

906
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,320
woman.

907
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,800
And I need to see a new draft
on that piece...

908
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,120
about shopping for a plastic surgeon-
It's dull.

909
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,560
And this layout
for the Winter Wonderland spread.

910
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,920
Not wonderful yet.

911
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,760
Oh, okay. L-I'll look at it.

912
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,320
What about Testino?
Where are we on that?

913
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,360
Zac Posen's doing
some very sculptural suits.

914
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,280
So I suggested that, uh, Testino
shoot them at the Noguchi Garden.

915
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,080
Perfect.

916
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,640
Thank God somebody came to work today.

917
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,360
What about accessories for April?

918
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,840
One thought I had was enamel.
Um, bangles, pendants, earrings.

919
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,960
No. We did that two years ago.
What else?

920
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,240
Um, well, they're showing a lot of florals
right now, so I was thinking-

921
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,560
Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.

922
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,000
But we thought about shooting them
in an industrial space.

923
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,800
We thought the contrast
between the femininity of the florals...

924
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,520
and the more raw, rough-hewn background
would create this wonderful tension between-

925
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,560
- No.
- Which?

926
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,280
- No.
- Which?

927
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,320
- [Emily Coughing]
- No.

928
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,520
[Coughing Continues]

929
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,320
Does anybody else
have anything I can possibly use?

930
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,080
Antibacterial wipes perhaps?

931
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,320
[Groans]

932
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,440
- How's the cold doing?
- Like death warmed up actually.

933
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,560
[Sniffles]
Oh, God.

934
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,800
It's the benefit tonight.
I've been looking forward to it for months.

935
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,960
I refuse to be sick.
I'm wearing Valentino, for crying out loud.

936
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,600
Right. Well, everybody will
be leaving soon to get ready...

937
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,600
so I suggest you go and drop Miranda's
Fendi bag off at the showroom...

938
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,560
and then I suppose you can just go home.

939
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,640
Yeah? Oh, well, that is great.
Perfect actually.

940
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,920
I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before it closes.
It's Nate's birthday tonight.

941
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,560
So we're, uh,
having a little party for him.

942
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,600
Yeah, I'm hearing this,
and I wanna hear this.

943
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,120
Bye.

944
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,520
I love my job.
I love my job. I love my job.

945
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,640
[Chattering]

946
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,600
[Cell Phone Rings]

947
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,680
Hello?

948
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,600
Before the benefit tonight,
I need to make sure...

949
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,240
that you're both fully prepped
on the guest list.

950
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:35,680
But I thought that only
the first assistant went to the benefit.

951
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,160
Only when the first assistant
hasn't decided to become...

952
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,640
an incubus of viral plague.

953
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,920
You'll come and help Emily.

954
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,160
- That's all.
- Right.

955
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,440
These are all of the guests.
Miranda invites everyone.

956
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,080
We have to make sure that they all think
she knows exactly who they are.

957
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,240
And I've been studying for weeks.

958
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,040
I have to learn all these by tonight?

959
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,200
No, don't be silly, Andrea.
These too.

960
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,960
Look, you better just start without me, okay?
I'll get there as soon as I can.

961
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,080
Andy, come on, it's his birth-

962
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,160
Okay, but hurry.

963
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,880
Oh, please, believe me, I will.
This is the last thing that I wanna-

964
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,640
Ooh, I love that. Uh, I'll call you
the second I'm leaving, okay?

965
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,120
- Will that fit me?
- Oh, yeah.

966
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,840
A little Crisco and some fishing line,
and we're in business.

969
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,080
Well, nothing really. I mean, this is-

970
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,200
I mean, really, this is
the social event of the season.

Andy, you look so chic.

Oh, thanks, Em. You look so thin.

974
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,560
- Do I?
- Yeah.

975
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,960
Oh, it's for Paris.
I'm on this new diet.

976
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,880
It's very effective.
Well, I don't eat anything.

977
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,240
And then when I feel like I'm about to faint,
I eat a cube of cheese.

978
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,160
- Well, it's definitely working.
- I know.

979
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,680
I'm just one stomach flu
away from my goal weight.

That's John Folger, the new
artistic director of the Chelsea Rep.

983
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,240
- John, thanks for coming.
- Hey there.

984

- [John] Oh, thank you.
It's always nice seeing you.
- Stop fidgeting.

985
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,560
I'm sorry. I'm so late.

986
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,600
Just deal with it.
You have to be here.

987
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,840
Emily, come here.

988
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,680
Isn't thatJacqueline Follet
from French Runway?

989
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,840
Oh, my God, and Miranda hates her.

990
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,840
She was supposed to arrive
after Miranda left.

991
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,360
- I didn't- Oh.
- Yeah.

992
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,920
- Miranda, fabulous event as always.
- You broughtJacqueline.

993
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,520
- Surprise.
- Quelle surprise.

994
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,920
Oh, wonderful. We're so happy you were
able to come to our little gathering.

995
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,600
Of course.
I plan my whole year around this.

996
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,320
Well, we're so grateful that you do.

997
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,680
- Ciao.
- Have you gotten my note?

998
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,920
Yes, I did.
We'll discuss it on Wednesday.

999
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,440
- Yes, I agree. No business tonight.
- Not tonight.
