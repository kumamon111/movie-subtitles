### 重要表現


### Chapter 5

690
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,560
Emily?

691
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,480
Call James Holt's office. Tell them I want
to move the preview up to today at 12:30.

692
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,240
Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.

693
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,880
But we're not expected until Tuesday.
Did she say why?

694
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,640
Yes. Yeah, she explained every detail
of her decision making.

695
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,600
And then we brushed each other's hair
and gabbed about American Idol.

696
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,520
I see your point.

697
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,880
- [Andy] What's a preview anyway?
- Good morning, Miranda.

698
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,800
[Nigel] Miranda insists upon seeing
all the designers'collections...

699
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,720
before they show them.

700
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,680
- Great to see you.
- Hello, James.

701
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,600
- [Andy] And she tells them what she thinks?
- [Nigel] In her way.

702
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,040
Uh, this season really began for me
with a meditation...

703
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,680
on the intersection
between East and West.

704
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,120
[Nigel] There's a scale.
One nod is good. Two nods is very good.

705
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,200
There's only been one actual smile on record,
and that was Tom Ford in 2001.

706
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,200
An obi belt.

707
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,320
[Nigel]
She doesn't like it, she shakes her head.

708
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,000
This is the dress that we have designed
specifically and exclusively for you.

709
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,880
[Nigel] Then, of course,
there's the pursing of the lips.

710
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,760
[Andy]
Which means?

711
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,560
[Nigel]
Catastrophe.

712
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,760
[Whispers]
Just, uh-Just go.

713
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,400
- I just don't understand. I'm appalled.
- It's absurd. Appalled.

714
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,680
- You deal with it.
- I'll talk to him.

715
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,760
So because she pursed her lips,
he's gonna change his entire collection?

716
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,760
You still don't get it, do you?

717
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,680
Her opinion is the only one
that matters.

718
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,560
- Call my husband and confirm dinner.
- At Pastis? Done.

719
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,560
And I'll need a change of clothes.

720
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,440
Well, I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.

721
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,000
Fine. And, Andrea, I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

722
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,480
- Have Emily give you the key.
- Mm-hmm.

723
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,960
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.

724
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,720
You know, if I can deliver the Book,
that means I must have done something right.

725
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,640
I'm not a psycho.

726
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,120
Oh, and, you know,
she called me Andrea?

727
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,760
I mean, she didn't call me Emily,
which is- Isn't that great?

728
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,320
Yeah, whoopee. Right.

729
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,080
Now, it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

730
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,040
Oh. Okay.

731
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,240
[Emily]
The Book is assembled by 10:00, 10:30...

732
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,600
and you must wait around for it
until then.

733
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,080
You will be delivering Miranda's
dry cleaning with the Book.

734
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,880
Now, the car will take you straight
to Miranda's townhouse.

735
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,280
You let yourself in.

736
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,800
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.

737
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,880
Do not look at anyone.

738
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,520
This is of the utmost importance.
You must be invisible.

739
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,760
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.

740
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,160
You open the door
and you walk across the foyer.

741
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,720
You hang the dry cleaning
in the closet across from the staircase.

742
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,800
- Uh-
- And you leave the Book
on the table with the flowers.

743
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,240
[Panting]

744
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,040
- Shit!
- [Girl] It's that door to the left.

745
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,000
Okay.

746
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,080
[Whispers]
Thank you.

747
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,000
- You can give the Book to us.
- Shh. Which-Which table?

748
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,560
- It's okay. Come on up.
- No, I can't. I can't.

749
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,640
- What? It's okay.
- Come on.

750
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,120
- Yeah, come on. It's okay.
- Please stop talking.

751
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,680
Or you can bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.

752
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,520
She does? Right.
She does, all the time.

753
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,560
Yeah? Okay.

754
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,920
[Giggling]

755
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,320
[Miranda] What did you expect me to do,
walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?

756
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,440
[Man] I rushed out of
an investment committee meeting...

757
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,120
and I sat there waiting for you
for almost an hour.

758
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,600
I told you the cell phones didn't work.
Nobody could get a signal out.

759
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,760
[Man] I knew what everyone
in that restaurant was thinking-

760
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,480
there he is, waiting for her again.

761
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,080
- Okay, okay! Okay, okay.
- Oh, no. Shh!

762
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,320
It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.

763
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,760
The twins said hello,
so I said hello back.

764
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,680
- Then I went up the stairs
to give her the Book and-
- You went upstairs?

765
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,400
Oh, my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed
with her and ask for a bedtime story?

766
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,400
Okay, I made a mistake. I know.

767
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,080
Andrea, you don't understand.

768
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,040
If you get fired,
that might jeopardize Paris for me.

769
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,040
If that happens, I will search every Blimpie's
in the tristate area until I track you down.

770
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,000
She's gonna fire me?

771
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,920
I don't know. She's not happy.

772
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,840
[Miranda]
Andrea?

773
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,640
[Snaps Fingers]

774
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,840
Miranda, about last night, l-

775
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,400
I need the new Harry Potter book
for the twins.

776
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,840
Okay. Okay. I'll go down
to Barnes & Noble right now.

777
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,480
Did you fall down and smack
your little head on the pavement?

778
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,040
Not that I can recall.

779
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,880
We have all the published Harry Potter books.
The twins want to know what happens next.

780
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,280
You want the unpublished manuscript?

781
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,040
We know everyone in publishing.
It shouldn't be a problem, should it?

782
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,240
And you can do anything, right?

783
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,360
[Cell Phone Rings]

784
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,400
Yes, Bobbsey. I know, baby.

785
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,880
Mommy's working very hard
to get it for you.

786
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,800
She doesn't get it.

787
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,600
I could call frickin'J.K. Rowling herself.
I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.

788
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,800
My girls are leaving on the train
for their grandmother's at 4:00...

789
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,240
so the book better be here
no later than 3:00.

790
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,840
- Of course!
- And I would like my steak here in 15 minutes.

791
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,400
No problem!
[Panting]

792
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,680
Okay. I have four hours
to get the impossible manuscript.

793
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,960
Smith & Wollensky's doesn't open until 11:30.
How am I gonna get the steak?

794
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,440
Okay. I will be back in 15 minutes.

795
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,720
- Wish me luck!
- No. Shan't.

796
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I've been on hold.
It's for Miranda Priestly.

797
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,560
It's very important.

798
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,840
Yes, I know it's impossible to get...

799
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,360
but, well, I was wondering if you
could make the impossible possible...

800
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,320
if that's at all possible.
[Laughing]

801
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,760
Yes, I'm calling about
the Harry Potter manuscript.

802
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,560
Uh, no. Unpublished.

803
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,880
Not a chance?

804
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,880
Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.

805
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
'Cause I think it makes a difference.

806
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,520
Let me call you back.

807
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,400
You probably don't remember me.
We met atJames Holt's party.

808
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,360
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.

809
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,480
The Harry Potter manuscript?
Oh, you're kidding.

810
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,880
Uh, sorry to ask, but I'm desperate.

811
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,080
Just tell her it can't be done.
You'll have to come up with a Plan "B."

812
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,560
Well, this is Miranda Priestly
we're talking about.

813
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,720
There is no Plan "B."
There's only Plan "A."

814
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,000
Is she back? Am I fired?

815
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,840
I rarely say this to people
who aren't me...

816
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,560
but you have got to calm down.

817
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,560
Bloody hell!

818
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,680
Coat, bag.

819
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,600
What's that? Oh, I don't want that.
I'm having lunch with Irv.

820
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,600
I'll be back at 3:00.
I'd like my Starbucks waiting.

821
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,560
Oh, and if you don't have
that Harry Potter book by then...

822
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,240
don't even bother coming back.

823
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,400
[Phone Rings]

824
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,760
Hello.

825
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,760
Quit? Are you sure?

826
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,760
I failed.
She's gonna fire me anyway.

827
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,240
- I might as well beat her to the punch.
- Wow.

828
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,040
Andy, good for you.
Congratulations. You're free.

829
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,000
- Yeah. Well, listen, I'll call you later.
- Okay.

830
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,520
- [Line Clicks, Phone Rings]
- Hello.

831
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,520
I'm brilliant. No, really.

832
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,680
- Monuments should be erected in my honor.
- You didn't.

833
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,120
Oh, yes. A friend of a friend
does the cover art...

834
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,040
and she happens
to have the manuscript.

835
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,040
Oh, no, 'cause that would mean
that I actually did something right.

836
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,280
[Chuckles]
It's just- Oh!

837
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,200
The thing is, Christian, I was just-

838
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,480
Look, you want this thing, you better hurry.
I'll meet you at the St. Regis.
